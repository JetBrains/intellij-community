//! The core of `bt`, the agent-facing wrapper over `bazel test`: selector resolution, the areas and their lanes,
//! the suite catalog, Bazel test runs, and BEP and test.xml reading.
//!
//! A raw test run costs an agent hundreds of lines of bazel progress and summary noise, and `--test_output=errors`
//! dumps whole test logs (one failing test's test.xml measured 146 KB, almost all of it `<system-out>` platform-log
//! noise). So a caller passes a bare test class name, this crate resolves the label and the FQN itself, the `bt`
//! binary runs bazel with the UI silenced, reads results structurally out of the Build Event Protocol plus test.xml,
//! and answers a digest.
//!
//! # Areas
//!
//! This crate knows no path of any product. `bt.json` at the repository root names each area: a directory that
//! resolution scans, and the lane table of that directory ([`Areas`]). A lane table can also name a suite catalog,
//! which a flow or a suite selector reads.
//!
//! # A library with more than one consumer
//!
//! The `bt` binary is one consumer. The Air UI-lane controller and its trace planner resolve a lane or a selector
//! through the same [`Lanes`], [`Selector`], [`ResolutionInputs`] and [`resolve_selector`], so the lane table and
//! selector resolution are spelled once. For the same reason the production [`Runtime`] is injected by each
//! consumer: `bt` runs bazel, and the controller's selector resolution must never start a subprocess from inside a
//! held lease.
