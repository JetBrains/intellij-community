"Return exit code 0 for --{help,version,info}" committed on Feb 29 by lsf37

1. Emitter.java: zzBufferL is treated as CharSequence instead of char[]
2. Emitter.java: reworked ZZ_CMAP to an optimized multi-level table (see java.lang.CharacterDataXX)
   For this purpose EmitterCM.java is introduced to resemble a variant of
   generatecharacter/GenerateCharacter.java from http://hg.openjdk.java.net tailored to our needs.
