The following changes to JFlex 1.4.3 have been done by JetBrains developers:

July 26, 2005:

 * JFlexTask.java: Added setCharAt() method for setting the -charat option from Ant
   builds.

July 8, 2005:

 * Main.java, Options.java, Emitter.java: Added new command line option -charat.
   The option replaces array index access when accessing the zzBufferL array with 
   calls to the .charAt() method.
