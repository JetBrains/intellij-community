     * Highlights [code] according to rules for the language specified by [mimeType], and returns flow of styled
     * strings. For basic highlighters with rigid color schemes it is enough to return a flow of one element:
     * ```
     * return flowOf(highlightedString(code, mimeType))
     * ```
     *
     * However, some implementations might want gradual highlighting (for example, apply something simple while waiting
     * for the extensive info from server), or they might rely upon a color scheme that can change at any time.
     *
     * In such cases, they need to produce more than one styled string for the same piece of code, and that's when flows
     * come in handy.
