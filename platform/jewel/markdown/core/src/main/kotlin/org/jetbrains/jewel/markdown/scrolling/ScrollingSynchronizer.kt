/**
 * To support synchronized scrolling between source and preview, we need to establish a mapping between source lines and
 * coordinates of their presentation.
 *
 * For simplicity, let's suppose that the source code is immutable. [MarkdownProcessor] parses it and yields a list of
 * [MarkdownBlock]s. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain any information about the source lines, as the need to keep them
 * and reserve more heap is not strong enough (the hypothesis is that most users just need to read the .md file and not
 * to edit it).
 *
 * However, [MarkdownProcessor] uses commonmark inside and takes the blocks this library returns to build
 * [MarkdownBlock]s, and in the editor mode, commonmark blocks still hold the information about source lines.
 * [acceptBlockSpans] can be implemented the way that remembers mappings between [MarkdownBlock]s and source lines these
 * blocks span over.
 *
 * Next, Compose provides the callback [onGloballyPositioned] with precalculated global layout. [acceptGlobalPosition]
 * can be implemented to remember mappings between [MarkdownBlock]s and global coordinates these blocks are rendered on.
 *
 * These two mappings are enough to make the synchronizer work. When a source code is scrolled to a line, an
 * implementation can find a block containing the line (or the next one if there are no blocks on the line), then find
 * this block's global layout and, finally, tell Compose to scroll to the topmost coordinate of the layout. This way, a
 * user can observe the whole block in the preview, even if only a part of it is visible in the source view.
 *
 * For some blocks, however, it makes sense to scroll within their content. Code blocks make for a perfect example of
 * it. They can contain a lot of lines, and at the same time, they're not soft-wrapped in a preview, every source line
 * is mapped 1:1 to the preview, so scrolling inside a code block would be preferable (and natural) to support.
 * [acceptTextLayout] serves the purpose of calculation every line's position within the composable. This information
 * may, in turn, be used together with global positioning of the composable to compute the absolute position of a
 * certain line in the preview.
 *
 * # Editing
 *
 * [MarkdownProcessor] always yields all the blocks that are present in the source, even in optimized mode, so
 * [acceptBlockSpans] is not really affected by editing. [acceptGlobalPosition] is trickier, as it is not triggered on
 * blocks preceding the change. [acceptTextLayout] is even more intricate, as it may or may not be triggered on blocks
 * following the change. It implies that mappings should be adjusted accordingly. [beforeProcessing] and
 * [afterProcessing] can help with that, as they're invoked before and after every re-parse, i.e. every change in the
 * file. See [PerLine] as one of the possible implementations for [ScrollState].
 *
 * # Keep in mind
 * - [acceptBlockSpans] accepts blocks in the **depth-first order**.
 * - Between [beforeProcessing] and [afterProcessing] every single block is processed, [acceptBlockSpans] is triggered
 *   for every one of them.
 * - [acceptGlobalPosition] is **always** triggered on the changed block and the blocks that follow the change.
 * - [acceptTextLayout] is **always** triggered on the changed block, but **not always** on those located below the
 *   changed block. It's **not triggered** on blocks located above the change.
 * - [acceptTextLayout] is triggered **before** [acceptGlobalPosition] for the same block.
