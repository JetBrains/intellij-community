/**
 * Basically, the testcase is about reading values from yet unallocated addresses of {@link ResizeableMappedFile}.
 * Currently {@link ResizeableMappedFile} allows it, but this is a kind of undocumented feature, which wasn't really
 * designed that way, but just so happens -- and client code rely on it sometimes.
 * <p>
 * If underlying buffer of {@link ResizeableMappedFile} wasn't zeroed before use it could contain anything (most
 * likely values from previous use) and reads from unallocated area will return that "anything". This is dangerous
 * by itself, but it could lead to even more interesting issues in scenarios with conditional writes, like
 * if(newValue != getLong(addr)) -> putLong(addr, newValue). If one uses conditional write, and it so happens
 * garbage from unallocated area == newValue, then write will be bypassed. But next not-bypassed write will
 * 'allocate' the area, and _zero it_. Now buffer contains zeros there previously it has contained newValue,
 * and next try to re-read getLong(addr) will return 0, while it is expected to return newValue -- because
 * we just (conditionally) put it there!
 * <p>
 * Now this may look as a very rare case, because it is unlikely to have arbitrary int/long value to be equal to your
 * newValue. But it is not as rare as one may think, because values in unallocated areas of buffer is not something
 * random -- they are the values from previous use. So if app has a set of values it frequently writes into RMF (e.g. flags,
 * or booleans, or just a lot of small numbers), then chance of such a 'collision' is not minor.
