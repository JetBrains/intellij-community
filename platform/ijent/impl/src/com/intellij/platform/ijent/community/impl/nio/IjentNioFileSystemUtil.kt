 * We need to use a plain `runBlocking` here.
 * The IO call is supposed to be fast (several milliseconds in the worst case),
 * so the cost of spawning and destroying an additional thread in Dispatchers.Default would be too big.
 * Also, IJent does not require any outer lock in its implementation, so a deadlock is not possible.
 *
 * In addition, we suppress work stealing in this `runBlocking`, as it should return as fast as it can on its own.
