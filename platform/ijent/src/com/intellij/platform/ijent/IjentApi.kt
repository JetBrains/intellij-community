 * Provides access to an IJent process running on some machine. An instance of this interface gives ability to run commands
 * on a local or a remote machine. Every instance corresponds to a single machine, i.e. unlike Run Targets, if IJent is launched
 * in a Docker container, every call to execute a process (see [IjentExecApi]) runs a command in the same Docker container.

 * Usually, [IjentSessionProvider] creates instances of [IjentApi].
