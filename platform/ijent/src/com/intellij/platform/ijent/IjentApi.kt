 * Provides access to an IJent process running on some machine.
 * An instance of this interface gives the ability to run commands on a local or a remote machine. Every instance corresponds to
 * a single machine, i.e., unlike Run Targets, if IJent is launched in a Docker container, every call to execute a process
 * (see [com.intellij.platform.eel.EelExecApi]) runs a command in the same Docker container.
 *
 * Usually, [com.intellij.platform.ijent.deploy] creates instances of [com.intellij.platform.ijent.IjentApi].
