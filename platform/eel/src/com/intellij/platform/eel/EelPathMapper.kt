   * Example:
   * If `path` points to `C:\Users\Me\archive.zip`, and this Eel is running on WSL,
   * then the file gets uploaded to WSL distribution and the returned path could point to `/tmp/archive.zip`.
   *
   * The entry is transferred completely, i.e., if it is a directory, then it is copied recursively with contents.
   * Symbolic links are **not** followed.
   *
   * If [path] and [EelApi] are located on the same environment, then this function is equivalent to [getOriginalPath].
   * Otherwise, this function copies the entry to an implementation-defined location.
   *
   * [scope] is used to control the lifetime of the files that have been transferred. When [scope] is closed, the files will be deleted
