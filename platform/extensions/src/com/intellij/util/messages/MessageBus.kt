  /**
   * Allows retrieving an interface for publishing messages to the target topic.
   *
   * Basically, the whole processing looks as follows:
   *
   *  1. Messaging clients create new [connections][MessageBusConnection] within the target message bus and
   * [subscribe][MessageBusConnection.subscribe] to the target [topics][Topic];
   *
   *  1. Every time somebody wants to send a message for a particular topic, he or she calls current method and receives an object
   * that conforms to the [business interface][Topic.getListenerClass] of the target topic. Every method call on that
   * object is dispatched by the messaging infrastructure to the subscribers.
   * [broadcasting][Topic.getBroadcastDirection] is performed if necessary as well;
   *
   * It's also very important to understand message processing strategy in case of **nested dispatches**.
   * Consider the following situation:
   *
   *  1. `Subscriber<sub>1</sub>` and `subscriber<sub>2</sub>` are registered for the same topic within
   * the same message bus;
   *
   *  1. `Message<sub>1</sub>` is sent to that topic within the same message bus;
   *  1. Queued message delivery starts;
   *  1. Queued message delivery ends as there are no messages queued but not dispatched;
   *  1. `Message<sub>1</sub>` is queued for delivery to both subscribers;
   *  1. Queued messages delivery starts;
   *  1. `Message<sub>1</sub>` is being delivered to the `subscriber<sub>1</sub>`;
   *  1. `Subscriber<sub>1</sub>` sends `message<sub>2</sub>` to the same topic within the same bus;
   *  1. Queued messages delivery starts;
   *
   * **Important:** `subscriber<sub>2</sub>` is being notified about all queued but not delivered messages,
   * i.e. its callback is invoked for the message<sub>1</sub>;
   *
   *  1. Queued messages delivery ends because all subscribers have been notified on the `message<sub>1</sub>`;
   *  1. `Message<sub>2</sub>` is queued for delivery to both subscribers;
   *  1. Queued messages delivery starts;
   *  1. `Subscriber<sub>1</sub>` is notified on `message<sub>2</sub>`
   *  1. `Subscriber<sub>2</sub>` is notified on `message<sub>2</sub>`
   *
   * **Thread-safety.**
   * All subscribers are notified sequentially from the calling thread.
   *
   * **Memory management.**
   * Returned objects are very light-weight and stateless, so, they are cached by the message bus in `'per-topic'` manner.
   * That means that caller of this method is not obliged to keep returned reference along with the reference to the message for
   * further publishing. It's enough to keep reference to the message bus only and publish
   * like `'messageBus.syncPublisher(targetTopic).targetMethod()'`.
   *
   * @param topic target topic
   * @param <L>   [business interface][Topic.getListenerClass] of the target topic
   * @return publisher for a target topic
