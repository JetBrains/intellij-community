/**
 * Specifies that an element of the program is not an user-visible string which needs to be localized,
 * or does not contain such strings. This annotation is intended to be used by localization tools for
 * detecting strings which should not be reported as requiring localization.
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a method parameter is annotated with {@code NonNls}, the strings passed
 * as values of this parameter are not reported as requiring localization.
 * Also, if the parameter of a property setter method is annotated with {@code NonNls}, values
 * of that property in UI Designer forms are never highlighted as hard-coded strings.</li>
 * <li>If a field is annotated with {@code NonNls}, all string literals found in the
 * initializer of the field are not reported as requiring localization.</li>
 * <li>If a method is called on a field, parameter or local variable annotated with {@code NonNls},
 * string literals passed as parameters to the method are not reported as requiring localization.
 * <li>If a field, parameter or local variable annotated with {@code NonNls} is passed as a
 * parameter to the {@code equals()} method invoked on a string literal, the literal is not
 * reported as requiring localization.</li>
 * <li>If a field, parameter or local variable annotated with {@code NonNls} is found at
 * the left side of an assignment expression, all string literals in the right side
 * of the expression are not reported as requiring localization.</li>
 * <li>If a method is annotated with {@code NonNls}, string literals returned from the method
 * are not reported as requiring localization.</li>
 * <li>If a class is annotated with {@code NonNls}, all string literals in
 * the class and all its subclasses are not reported as requiring localization.</li>
 * <li>If a package is annotated with {@code NonNls}, all string literals in
 * the package and all its subpackages are not reported as requiring localization.</li>
 * </ul>
