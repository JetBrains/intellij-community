/**
 * We have a framework for persisting component states (see {@link State} {@link Storage}). It allows to specify which file
 * should hold persisting data. There is a number of standard file system anchors like 'workspace file', 'project config dir' which
 * can be used for defining a storage file's path. Hence, IJ provides special support for such anchors in the form of macros,
 * i.e. special markers that are mapped to the current file system environment at runtime.
 * <p/>
 * This class holds those markers and utility method for working with them.
