/**
 * The IntelliJ Platform allows for persisting component states (see {@link State} and {@link Storage}).
 * It is possible to specify which file should hold persisting data.
 * There are a number of standard file system anchors like 'workspace file',
 * 'project config dir', which can be used for defining a storage file's path.
 * <p>
 * The platform provides special support for such anchors in the form of macros,
 * i.e., special markers that are mapped to the current file system environment at runtime.
 * <p>
 * This class holds those markers and utility method for working with them.
