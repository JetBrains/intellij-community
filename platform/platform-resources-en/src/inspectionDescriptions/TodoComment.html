Reports <b>TODO</b> comments in your code. The Format of
<b>TODO</b> comments is configurable via the <a href="settings://preferences.toDoOptions">Settings | Editor | TODO</a> panel. Since
syntax highlighting for <b>TODO</b> comments is already provided, it is expected that this will largely
be used in batch mode.
