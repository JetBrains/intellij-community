Reports issues essential to this file (e.g., syntax errors) in the result of a batch code inspection run.
These kinds of issues are usually always highlighted when you open the file in the editor and can't be configured (unlike inspections).
The options below are controlling the analysis level of this inspection:
<ul>
  <li>Option "<b>Highlight syntax errors</b>" allows to report parser-related issues.</li>
  <li>Option "<b>Run language annotators</b>" allows to report issues found by annotators configured for this language.
    See <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/annotator.html">Custom Language Support: Annotators</a> for details.</li>
  <li>Option "<b>Run language-specific highlight visitors</b>" allows to report issues inherent to this file language (e.g., type mismatches or unreported exceptions etc.).
    See <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/syntax-highlighting-and-error-highlighting.html#semantic-highlighting">Custom Language Support: Highlighting</a> for details.</li>
