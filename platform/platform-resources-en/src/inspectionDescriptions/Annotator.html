Reports issues essential to this file (e.g., syntax errors) in the result of a batch code inspection run.
These issues are usually always highlighted in the editor and can't be configured, unlike inspections.
These options control the scope of checks performed by this inspection:
<ul>
  <li>Option "<b>Report syntax errors</b>": report parser-related issues.</li>
  <li>Option "<b>Report issues from language-specific annotators</b>": report issues found by annotators configured for the relevant language.
    See <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/annotator.html">Custom Language Support: Annotators</a> for details.</li>
  <li>Option "<b>Report other highlighting problems</b>": report issues specific to the language of the current file (e.g., type mismatches or unreported exceptions).
    See <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/syntax-highlighting-and-error-highlighting.html#semantic-highlighting">Custom Language Support: Highlighting</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
