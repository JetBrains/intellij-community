Reports files with line separators different from the ones that are specified in the project's settings.
<p>For example, the inspection will be triggered if you set the line separator to <code>\n</code> in
  <a href="settings://preferences.sourceCode?Line%20separator">Settings | Editor | Code Style | Line separator</a>,
  while the file you are editing uses <code>\r\n</code> as a line separator.</p>

<p>The inspection also warns you about mixed line separators within a file.</p>
