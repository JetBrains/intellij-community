Reports known Javac issues, performance problems, and incompatibilities.
For example, type inference may be slow when it has to process many nested calls.
<p>The following code triggers a warning, as the vararg method call has 50+ poly arguments:</p>
<pre><code>
  Arrays.asList(
      Arrays.asList("a1", "b1"),
      Arrays.asList("a2", "b2"),
      ...
      Arrays.asList("a100", "b100"));
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix adds explicit type arguments, which makes compilation and IDE processing much faster:</p>
<pre><code>
  //noinspection RedundantTypeArguments
  Arrays.&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;asList(
      Arrays.asList("a1", "b1"),
      Arrays.asList("a2", "b2"),
      ...
      Arrays.asList("a100", "b100"));
</code></pre>
