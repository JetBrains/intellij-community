/**
 * The core element of the Poly Symbols framework. It is identified through `name` and `qualifiedKind` properties.
 * The symbol has a very generic meaning and may represent a variable in some language, or an endpoint of some web server,
 * or a file.
 *
 * Symbols, which share some common characteristics should be grouped using the same `qualifiedKind`.
 * The `qualifiedKind` consists of a `namespace`, which roughly indicates a language or a framework the symbol belongs to,
 * and a `kind`, which roughly indicates, what the symbol basic characteristics are.
 *
 * [PolySymbol]s provide a straightforward way of implementing:
 * - navigation support - through [PolySymbol.getNavigationTargets] method
 * - documentation support - through [PolySymbol.getDocumentationTarget] method and
 *   [com.intellij.polySymbols.documentation.PolySymbolDocumentationTarget.create] utility
 * - search support - through [PolySymbol.searchTarget] property. [PolySymbol] may also implement the [SearchTargetSymbol] or
 *   [SearchTarget] interfaces, if a non-[PolySymbolSearchTarget] is required. In such a case, however, the search support
 *   will have to be implemented from scratch using [UsageSearcher].
 * - rename support - through [PolySymbol.renameTarget] property. [PolySymbol] may also implement the [RenameableSymbol] or
 *   [RenameTarget] interfaces, if a non-[PolySymbolRenameTarget] is required. In such a case, however, the rename support
 *   will have to be implemented from scratch using [RenameUsageSearcher].
 *
 * Symbols should be provided to the framework through [PolySymbolQueryScopeContributor] and
 * retrieved using [PolySymbolQueryExecutor] acquired using [PolySymbolQueryExecutorFactory].
 * The PolySymbol framework requires an integration into language or framework support through:
 * - completion provider - you can use `com.intellij.polySymbols.completion.PolySymbolsCompletionProviderBase`
 * - reference contributor - use `com.intellij.polySymbols.references.PsiPolySymbolReferenceProvider`
 *
 * The [PolySymbolQueryExecutor] queries support evaluation of [PolySymbolWithPattern] patterns.
 * Symbols, which implement this interface and provide a pattern are expanded to a [PolySymbolMatch]
 * composite symbols during queries. Such patterns allow for handy implementation of a microsyntax.
 *
 * Each symbol can be a scope for other symbols (like a Java class is a scope for its methods and fields). Such symbols
 * should implement [PolySymbolScope] interface. When pattern evaluation is happening, each matched symbol's `queryScope`
 * is put on the scope stack, allowing for expanding the scope during the pattern match process.
 *
 * The symbol lifecycle is a single read action. If you need it to survive between read actions,
 * use [PolySymbol.createPointer] to create a symbol pointer.
 * If the symbol is still valid, dereferencing the pointer might return a new instance of the symbol.
 * During write action, the symbol might not survive PSI tree commit, so you should create a pointer
 * before the commit and dereference it afterward.
 *
 * See also: [Implementing Poly Symbols](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/websymbols-implementation.html)
