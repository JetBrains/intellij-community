/**
 * The main idea of this class - don't create value for remote value handle if already exists. So,
 * implementation of this class keep map of value to remote value handle.
 * Also, this class maintains cache timestamp.

 * Currently WIP implementation doesn't keep such map due to protocol issue. But V8 does.
