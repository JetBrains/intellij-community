/**
 * This was the first design. It's now deprecated in favor of [launchOnShow]/[launchOnceOnShow].
 *
 * 1. Exceptions from the [block] also cancel the returned Job.
 * For example, to execute some logic on the first time the component is shown, one can throw a CancellationException:
 * ```
 * myLabel.showingScope(myDebugName) {
 *   shownForTheFirstTimeEver(myLabel)
 *   throw CancellationException()
 * ```
 * Instead, [launchOnceOnShow] should be used.
 * In case of [launchOnShow], the [block] will be restarted even if the previous invocation threw an exception.
 *
 * 2. Synchronous [uiData] is not supported, the logic can be moved to the first line of [block].
 *
 * @param debugName name to use as [CoroutineName]
 * @param context additional context of the coroutine.
 * [CoroutineName], [Job], [ContinuationInterceptor][kotlin.coroutines.ContinuationInterceptor] and [ModalityState] are ignored
 * @param uiData a function, which is called in the same EDT event when the component becomes showing
