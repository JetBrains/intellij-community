/**
 * Executes [block] in a coroutine **once** the [UI component][this] becomes [showing][ComponentUtil.isShowing].
 *
 * When the component is hidden, the launched coroutine is cancelled.
 * In particular, the component becomes hidden when it's removed from the hierarchy.
 * If the component is shown again, then the coroutine is restarted
 * if it didn't run to completion the first time because it was canceled.
 *
 * The [block] is executed with the modality state of the [component][this].
 * This means that the [block] execution might happen in a different EDT event,
 * because it has to wait for the proper modality.
 *
 * The intended use of this function is to perform some sort of "slow initialization" that needs to be able to invoke suspending code.
 * Because some Swing containers are designed in such a way that components may be removed and then re-added
 * during content update, it's important to ensure that the initialization is restarted and allowed to complete.
 * This means that [block] must be coded in such a way that allows cancellation and restart.
 * Typically, it follows the compute-and-apply pattern where the "compute" part is idempotent and suspending,
 * and the "apply" part is pure UI code that is fast and not cancellable.
 *
 * It's not recommended to use this function with never-ending coroutines (e.g, `collect`),
 * as it's then identical to `launchOnShow` and that function should be used instead.
 *
 * @param debugName name to use as [CoroutineName]
 * @param context additional context of the coroutine.
 * [CoroutineName], [Job], [ContinuationInterceptor] and [ModalityState] are ignored
 * @see launchOnShow
