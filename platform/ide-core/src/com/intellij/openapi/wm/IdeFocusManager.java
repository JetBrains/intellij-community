/**
 * This class receives focus requests, manages the, and delegates to the AWT focus subsystem.
 * <p>
 * <em>All focus requests should be done through this class.</em>
 * <p>
 * For example, to request focus on a component:
 * <pre>
 *   IdeFocusManager.getInstance(project).requestFocus(comp, true);
 * </pre>
 * This is the preferred way to request focus on components to
 * <pre>
 *   comp.requestFocus();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This class is also responsible for delivering key events while focus transferring is in progress.
 * <p>
 * {@code IdeFocusManager} instance can be received per project or the global instance. The preferred way is
 * to use instance {@code IdeFocusManager.getInstance(project)}. If no project instance is available, then
 * {@code IdeFocusManager.getGlobalInstance()} can be used.
