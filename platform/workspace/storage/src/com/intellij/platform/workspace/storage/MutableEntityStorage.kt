/**
 * Writeable interface to storage. 
 * Use it if you need to build a storage from scratch or modify an existing storage in a way which requires reading its state after 
 * modifications.
 * 
 * In order to modify entities inside the IDE process, use functions from [WorkspaceModel][com.intellij.platform.backend.workspace.WorkspaceModel]
 * interface.
 * 
 * Instances of this interface are not thread safe.
 *
 * ## Adding, modifying and removing entities
 * 
 * In order to add a new entity to the storage, create it by calling the companion object of its interface and then pass it to [addEntity]
 * function:
 * ```kotlin
 * //mandatory properties are passed as parameters
 * val module = ModuleEntity(moduleName, dependencies, entitySource) { 
 *   //optional properties can be initialized in the lambda passed as the last parameter
 *   type = ModuleTypeId.JAVA_MODULE
 * }
 * ...
 * WorkspaceModel.getInstance(project).updateProjectModel("Add module") { builder ->
 *   builder.addEntity(module)
 * }  
 * ```
 * You may first prepare a whole tree of entities, and then add the root one to the storage, [addEntity] will automatically add all the
 * children.
 * 
 * In order to modify or remove an entity, you first need to find its instance in this instance of [MutableEntityStorage]. You can do this
 * by [resolving][SymbolicEntityId.resolve] its [SymbolicEntityId], or by [resolving][EntityReference.resolve] an [EntityReference], or
 * iterating by children of another entity:
 * ```
 * WorkspaceModel.getInstance(project).updateProjectModel("Update module") { builder ->
 *   val module = ModuleId(moduleName).resolve(builder) ?: ...
 *   val groupPath = module.groupPath ?: ...
 *   builder.removeEntity(groupPath)
 *   //a special extension function 'modifyEntity' is generated for each entity type
 *   builder.modifyEntity(module) {
 *     name = prefix + name
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Adding and removing child entities
 * 
 * There are two equivalent ways to add a child entity to an existing parent entity:
 * * specify parent when creating the child, and add the child via [addEntity]: 
 * ```
 * val contentRoot = ContentRootEntity(url, emptyList(), entitySource) {
 *   this.module = module
 * }
 * builder.addEntity(contentRoot)
 * ```
 * * call [modifyEntity] on the parent entity and modify its property to include the new child:
 * ```
 * val contentRoot = ContentRootEntity(url, emptyList(), entitySource)
 * builder.modifyEntity(module) {
 *   this.contentRoots = this.contentRoots + contentRoot
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * In order to remove a child entity, it's enough to call [removeEntity] for it, the reference in its parent will be update automatically.
 * Also, if the reference to the parent is declared as non-null in the child interface, it's enough to modify reference to the children
 * in the parent entity:
 * ```
 * builder.modifyEntity(module) {
 *   contentRoots = contentRoots.filter { it.url != contentUrlToRemove }
 * }
 * ```
 * If you do that for a child with nullable reference to the parent, the child will be detached from the parent but won't be removed from
 * the storage.
 * 
 * ## Batch operations
 * Besides operation with individual entities, [MutableEntityStorage] supports two batch operations: [addDiff] and [replaceBySource].
 * 
 * ### Add Diff
 * Each instance of [MutableEntityStorage] records changes made in it: addition, modification and removal of entities. Such changes made
 * in one instance may be applied to a different instance by calling [addDiff] function.
 *
 * **Use cases**:
 *
 * - **Parallel filling of the storage.**
 *
 *   Example: When configuration of a project is read from `*.iml` files, the IDE creates a separate empty [MutableEntityStorage] for each
 *   file, and run tasks which parse an `*.iml` file and load entities from it to the corresponding storage concurrently.
 *   When the tasks finish, their results are merged into the single storage via [addDiff].
 *
 * - **Accumulating changes.**
 *
 *   Example: This fits the case the user performs modifications in the "Project Structure" dialog. We don't want the changes to be
 *   applied immediately, so we accumulate changes in a builder and then add them to the main storage using the [addDiff] command when
 *   the user presses "apply" button.
 *
 * This is not a full list of use cases. You can use this operation based on your needs.
 * 
 * ### Replace by source
 *
 * Partially replace the storage with the new one based on the predicate.
 * This operation actualizes the part of the storage affected by the change trying to minimize the number of changes in the entities.
 *
 * **Rationale:**
 *
 * Usually, entities in the workspace model storage are created from data loaded from some configuration files. When these configuration
 * files change, we need to update the corresponding entities in the storage. It would be rather hard and error-prone to analyze what
 * exactly was changed in the files since the previous version, so we use a different approach. Each entity must specify its 
 * [source][WorkspaceEntity.entitySource] describing where the entity comes from.
 *
 * **Use cases**:
 *
 * - **Importing a project model from the external system.**
 *
 *   Example: In a maven project, we can create the project model each time we detect the `pom.xml` was changed. We apply the new project
 *   model to the main storage using the [replaceBySource] operation. This will affect only changed entities that were created from maven.
 *
 * - **Working with JPS build system**
 *
 *   Example: For entities loaded from configuration files from .idea directory, [entitySource][WorkspaceEntity.entitySource] points
 *   to the corresponding xml file. When IDE detects changes in some configuration files, it loads new entities from the created
 *   and modified files to a separate [MutableEntityStorage] instance, and then calls [replaceBySource] passing a filter which accepts
 *   entity sources corresponding to the all created, modified and deleted files and the prepared [MutableEntityStorage] instance.
 *
 * This is not a full list of use cases. You can use this operation based on your needs.
