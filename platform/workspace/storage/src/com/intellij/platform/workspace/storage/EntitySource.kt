/**
 * Describes a place where an entity came from. 
 * It may be a configuration file on disk (in that case [virtualFileUrl] property should be implemented to point to that file), or some 
 * strings which identify the source, or a marker object if entities are generated automatically by some algorithm which doesn't use 
 * external data.
 *
 * Each entity must specify its source via [WorkspaceEntity.entitySource] property. 
 * For example, entities loaded from configuration files under .idea directory use 
 * [JpsProjectFileEntitySource][com.intellij.platform.workspace.jps.JpsProjectFileEntitySource].
 * Information about entity sources is used by [MutableEntityStorage.replaceBySource] function.
 * 
 * An entity source must be serializable along with entities, so there are some restrictions on its implementation.
 * It must be a data class which contains read-only properties of the following types:
 * * primitive types;
 * * String;
 * * enum;
 * * [List] of another allowed type;
 * * another data class with properties of the allowed types;
 * * sealed abstract class where all implementations satisfy these requirements.

/**
 * Marker interface to represent entities which properties aren't loaded and which were added to the storage because other entities requires
 * them. Entities which sources implements this interface don't replace existing entities when [MutableEntityStorage.replaceBySource]
 * is called.
 *
 * For example if we have `FacetEntity` which requires `ModuleEntity`, and need to load facet configuration from *.iml file and load the module
 * configuration from some other source, we may use this interface to mark `entitySource` for `ModuleEntity`. This way when content of *.iml
 * file is applied to the model via [MutableEntityStorage.replaceBySource], it won't overwrite actual configuration
 * of `ModuleEntity`.
