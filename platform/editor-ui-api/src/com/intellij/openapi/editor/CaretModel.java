/**
 * Provides services for moving the caret and retrieving information about caret position.
 *
 * May support several carets existing simultaneously in a document. {@link #supportsMultipleCarets()} method can be used to find out
 * whether particular instance of CaretModel does it. If it does, query and update methods for caret position operate on a certain 'primary'
 * caret. There exists a way to perform the same operation(s) on each caret - see
 * {@link #runForEachCaret(CaretAction)} method. Within its context, query and update methods operate on the
 * current caret in that iteration. This behaviour can change in future though, so using caret and selection query and update methods in
 * actions that need to operate on multiple carets is discouraged - methods on {@link Caret} instances obtained
 * via {@link #getAllCarets()} or {@link #runForEachCaret(CaretAction)} should be used instead.
 * <p>
 * How 'primary' caret is determined by the model is not defined (currently it's the most recently added caret, but that can change).
 * <p>
 * At all times at least one caret will exist in a document.
 * <p>
 * Update methods, {@link #runBatchCaretOperation(Runnable)} and {@link #runForEachCaret(CaretAction)} methods
 * should only be run from EDT. Query methods can be run from any thread, when called not from EDT, those methods are 'not aware' of
 * 'runForEachCaret' scope - they will always return information about primary caret.
