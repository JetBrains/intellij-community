/**
 * Represents a logical position in the editor, including line and column values (both zero-based). Line value relates to the corresponding
 * line in the editor's {@link Document}. Column value counts characters from the beginning of the logical line (tab character can occupy
 * multiple columns - up to the tab size set for editor, surrogate pairs of characters are counted as one column). Positions beyond the end
 * of line can be represented (in this case column number will be larger than the number of characters in the line).
 * <p>
 * Logical position corresponds to a boundary between two characters and can be associated with either a preceding or succeeding character
 * (see {@link #leansForward}). This association makes a difference in a bidirectional text, where a mapping from logical to visual position 
 * is not continuous.
 * <p>
 * Logical position of caret in current editor is displayed in IDE's status bar (displayed line and column values are one-based, so they are
 * incremented before showing).
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> two objects of this class are considered equal if their logical line and column are equal. I.e. all logical positions
 * for soft wrap-introduced virtual space and the first document symbol after soft wrap are considered to be equal. Value of 
 * {@link #leansForward} flag doesn't impact the equality of logical positions.
