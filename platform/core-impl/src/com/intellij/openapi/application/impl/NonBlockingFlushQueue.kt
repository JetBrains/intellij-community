/**
 * Special UI Event Queue for runnables that interact with IJ Platform concepts, such as ModalityState and the RWI lock.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * Normally, the execution on top of AWT EventQueue is fair (see the contracts of [java.awt.EventQueue]).
 * IntelliJ Platform manipulates two entities that influence the ordering of events -- modality states and non-blocking write-intent lock.
 * Hence, each event scheduled here has two additional values in its metadata: modality state and whether it runs under write-intent lock.
 * An important part of this scheduler is that write-intent lock acquisition is non-blocking: if a runnable fails to acquire write-intent lock,
 * it needs to be rescheduled to try later.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to delay events in the way that retains ordering --
 * the main property of this scheduler is that
 * **if there are two events `A` and `B` with the same metadata, and scheduling of `A` happens-before scheduling of `B`, then `A` will be executed before `B`**
 * It is important that we do not enforce ordering guarantees between two runnables with different metadata:
 * if event `A` is non-modal and event `B` is modal, it is undefined which one will execute first.
 * Similarly, if event `A` requires lock and event `B` does not, it is undefined which one will execute first.
 *
 * ## Lock handling
 *
 * This class is an automaton with two states -- [WriteIntentLockMode.ALL] and [WriteIntentLockMode.UI_ONLY].
 * - In [WriteIntentLockMode.ALL] mode, the queue attempts to execute all runnables in order of their arrival.
 * If a runnable does not require write-intent lock, it can be executed right away;
 * if a runnable needs write-intent lock, [NonBlockingFlushQueue] acquires the lock in a non-blocking way.
 * If a lock cannot be acquired, the queue transitions into [WriteIntentLockMode.UI_ONLY]
 * and schedules a [WriteActionFinished] directive on termination of the existing write action.
 * - In [WriteIntentLockMode.UI_ONLY] mode, the queue runs only runnables that do not require write-intent lock.
 * When it reaches [WriteActionFinished], the queue transitions back to [WriteIntentLockMode.ALL].
 *
 * ## Modality handling
 *
 * Modality states also influence the ordering of events.
 * [NonBlockingFlushQueue] operates with two main queues: [writeIntentQueue] and [uiQueue].
 * When a polled runnable from each of those queues is deemed to have incorrect modality,
 * the runnables gets to respective skipped queue ([skippedWriteIntentQueue] or [skippedUiQueue]).
 * Once the modality state changes, skipped queues get appended back to the respective main queues.
 * While this might not sound optimal, modality changes are relatively rare in the IntelliJ Platform, so the overhead of processing is negligible.
 *
 * ## Ordering guarantees
 *
 * The runnables are scheduled to the main queues in order of their arrival.
 * The processing happens only on one thread, which ensures fairness of execution.
