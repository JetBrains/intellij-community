/**
 * Provides classes and methods to work with dates and durations. These classes are immutable (and

 *
 * <p>The time package contains some basic utilities for manipulating time (a delorean, police box
 * and grandfather clock?). These include a org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch for simple
 * performance measurements and an optimised {@link org.jetbrains.sqlite.date.FastDateFormat} class.
 *
 * <p>New in Lang 2.1 is the org.apache.commons.lang3.time.DurationFormatUtils class, which provides
 * various methods for formatting durations.
