   * Experimental. Please see implementation limitations.
   *
   * This function allows ignoring settings files events. For example Idea can ignore external
   * changes during reload.
   *
   * Note: All ignored modifications cannot be reverted. So if we ignore only create events
   * then if settings file was created and removed then we mark project status as modified,
   * because we can restore only delete event by CRCs.
   *
   * Note: Now create event and register settings file (file appear in settings files list) event
   * is same (also for delete and unregister), because we cannot find settings file if it doesn't
   * exist in file system. Usually settings files list forms during file system scanning.
   *
   * Note: This function will be called on EDT. Please make only trivial checks like:
   * ```context.modificationType == EXTERNAL && path.endsWith(".my-ext")```
   *
   * Note: [ReloadStatus.JUST_FINISHED] is used to ignore create events during reload. But we cannot
   * replace it by [ReloadStatus.IN_PROGRESS], because we should merge create and all next update
   * events into one create event and ignore all of them. So [ReloadStatus.JUST_FINISHED] true only
   * at the end of reload.
