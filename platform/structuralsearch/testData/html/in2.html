<h4>JetBrains Launches ReSharper Early Access Program for all Visual Studio .NET 2003 Users</h4>

<p class="bigtext"><b>JetBrains ReSharper plug-in enables intelligent C# code editing and powerful coding
    assistance to Visual Studio like those provided in Java by IntelliJ IDEA</b></p>

<p><b class="emp">Prague, Czech Republic, June 1, 2004</b> - JetBrains&trade;, Inc., creators of intelligent
    application development tools, today announced it has launched its Early Access Program (EAP) for JetBrains
    ReSharper&trade;, the company's powerful add-in tool for developers using Visual Studio.NET 2003. The ReSharper
    integrated plug-in enhances Visual Studio with powerful, intelligent C# code editing assistance and many of
    the same types of robust productivity enhancements they have come to rely on in the company's flagship
    IntelliJ IDEA IDE, now in version 4.0.
</p>

<p>Strong, positive comments by initial trial users have already spread through the Internet's C# developer
    community newsgroups. Now JetBrains is expanding the EAP to invite C# developers everywhere to download the
    latest preview version. ReSharper makes its power available within Visual Studio VS.NET 2003 with a convenient,
    integrated ReSharper menu, without significant slowdown of Visual Studio. ReSharper is available for download
    at https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper.
</p>

<p>&quot;Our early trial users have given us consistently great reports on ReSharper because it provides many of
    the same types of productivity enhancements in C# that IntelliJ IDEA provides in Java,&quot; said Eugene Belyaev,
    president and chief technology officer at JetBrains. &quot;By expanding the Early Adopter Program beyond our
    intellij.net online developer community, we now invite developers worldwide to help us make ReSharper an unmatched
    C# productivity tool in the Visual Studio environment.&quot;
</p>

<p>Key ReSharper features include:</p>
<ul class="starlist">
    <li>Tight integration with Visual Studio - no need to switch to outside application</li>
    <li>Greatly enhanced navigation, with powerful capabilities such as the ability to jump from a method to its
        declaration or from a method in a base class or interface to its implementation and back</li>
    <li>Convenient shortcuts to open a class or file by typing a partial name</li>
    <li>Powerful, intelligent code completion with such innovations as Smart Type Completion and multiple
        choices for variable naming, depending upon type</li>
    <li>Live Templates for context-based value substitution and automatic expansion of code</li>
    <li>Enhanced highlighting of fields, local variables, classes and more, plus error highlighting</li>
    <li>Refactoring support, now growing to include such key types as &quot;Rename,&quot; &quot;Change Method Signature,&quot;
        &quot;Introduce Variable&quot; and &quot;Extract Method&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Known for its consistent focus on increasing the productivity of developers, JetBrains continues to set the
    IDE technology standard with JetBrains ReSharper. For more information about JetBrains, visit
