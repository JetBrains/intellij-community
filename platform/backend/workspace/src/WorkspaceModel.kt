/**
 * Provides access to [the storage](psi_element://com.intellij.platform.workspace.storage) with entities describing the workspace model
 * inside the IDE process.
 * 
 * Use [currentSnapshot] to read the current state of the model. 
 * There are several ways to modify the model:
 * * [updateProjectModel] updates the model synchronously under write-lock; it should be used for small modifications;
 * * [replaceProjectModel] updates the model synchronously using a given replacement, which may be prepared in advance on a background 
 * thread; it should be used for major modifications to minimize time spent under write-lock;
 * * [update] schedules asynchronous update of the model; currently the actual update is performed with a write-lock in a blocking manner,
 * however, this will change in the future; this function is experimental for now, it can be used from suspending Kotlin functions.
 * 
 * In order to subscribe to changes in the workspace model, use [changesEventFlow] to process changes in an asynchronous manner. If you need
 * to process them synchronously, you may subscribe to [WorkspaceModelTopics.CHANGED] topic.
 * 
 * Instance of this interface can be obtained via [workspaceModel] extension property.
 * 
 * To provide interoperability with code which use the old project model API ([ModuleManager][com.intellij.openapi.module.ModuleManager],
 * [ModuleRootManager][com.intellij.openapi.roots.ModuleRootManager], [Library][com.intellij.openapi.roots.libraries.Library], etc.),
 * types of workspace entities corresponding to the old concepts are defined in [com.intellij.platform.workspace.jps.entities](psi_element://com.intellij.platform.workspace.jps.entities)
 * package. Implementations of old interfaces (so-called 'legacy bridges') use entities of these types to store data.
