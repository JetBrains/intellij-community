/**
 * Register an implementation of this interface as a handler for [WorkspaceModelTopics.CHANGED] to synchronously process changes in the 
 * workspace model.
 * 
 * For the asynchronous handling of changes from the workspace model collect them via [WorkspaceModel.changesEventFlow]
 *
 * # Behavior details
 *
 * The [EntityChange.Added] and [EntityChange.Removed] events are straightforward and generated in case of added or removed entities.
 *
 * The [EntityChange.Replaced] is generated in case if any of the fields of the entity changes the value in the newer
 *   version of storage.
 * This means that this event is generated in two cases: "primitive" field change (Int, String, data class, etc.) or
 *   changes of the references to other entities. The change of references may happen interectly by modifying the referred entity.
 *   For example, if we remove child entity, we'll generate two events: remove for child and replace for parent.
 *                if we add a new child entity, we'll also generate two events: add for child and replace for parent.
 *
 * # Examples
 *
 * Assuming the following structure of entities: A --> B --> C
 * Where A is the root entity and B and C are the children.
 *
 * - If we modify the primitive field of C: [Replace(C)]
 * - If we remove C: [Replace(B), Remove(C)]
 * - If we remove reference between B and C: [Replace(B), Replace(C)]
 * - If we remove B: [Replace(A), Remove(B), Remove(C)] - C is cascade removed
 *
 * Another example:
 * Before: A --> B  C, After A  C --> B
 * We have an entity `A` that has a child `B` and we move this child from `A` to `C`
 *
 * Produced events: [Replace(A), Replace(B), Replace(C)]
