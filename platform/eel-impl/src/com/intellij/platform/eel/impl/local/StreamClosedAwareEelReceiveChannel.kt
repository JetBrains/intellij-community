/**
 * A workaround for stdout and stderr from [java.lang.Process].
 *
 * [java.lang.Process.destroy] and [java.lang.Process.destroyForcibly] not only send a some signal to the process, but also immediately
 * close all streams despite possibly important data written by the process after receiving the signal.
 *
 * Without this class, an attempt to read anything after calling `destroy` would lead to [IOException] with the message "Stream closed".
 *
 * This class returns an indicator of a closed channel if the process was destroyed.
 * Even though the data is still lost, there's at least no unexpected error.
