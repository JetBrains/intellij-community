/**
 * A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and
 * high expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the
 * same functional specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and
 * includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of
 * {@code Hashtable}. However, even though all operations are
 * thread-safe, retrieval operations do <em>not</em> entail locking,
 * and there is <em>not</em> any support for locking the entire table
 * in a way that prevents all access.  This class is fully
 * interoperable with {@code Hashtable} in programs that rely on its
 * thread safety but not on its synchronization details.
 *
 * <p>Retrieval operations (including {@code get}) generally do not
 * block, so may overlap with update operations (including {@code put}
 * and {@code remove}). Retrievals reflect the results of the most
 * recently <em>completed</em> update operations holding upon their
 * onset. (More formally, an update operation for a given key bears a
 * <em>happens-before</em> relation with any (non-null) retrieval for
 * that key reporting the updated value.)  For aggregate operations
 * such as {@code putAll} and {@code clear}, concurrent retrievals may
 * reflect insertion or removal of only some entries.  Similarly,
 * Iterators, Spliterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the
 * state of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the
 * iterator/enumeration.  They do <em>not</em> throw {@link
 * java.util.ConcurrentModificationException ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.
 * Bear in mind that the results of aggregate status methods including
 * {@code size}, {@code isEmpty}, and {@code containsValue} are typically
 * useful only when a map is not undergoing concurrent updates in other threads.
 * Otherwise the results of these methods reflect transient states
 * that may be adequate for monitoring or estimation purposes, but not
 * for program control.
 *
 * <p>The table is dynamically expanded when there are too many
 * collisions (i.e., keys that have distinct hash codes but fall into
 * the same slot modulo the table size), with the expected average
 * effect of maintaining roughly two bins per mapping (corresponding
 * to a 0.75 load factor threshold for resizing). There may be much
 * variance around this average as mappings are added and removed, but
 * overall, this maintains a commonly accepted time/space tradeoff for
 * hash tables.  However, resizing this or any other kind of hash
 * table may be a relatively slow operation. When possible, it is a
 * good idea to provide a size estimate as an optional {@code
 * initialCapacity} constructor argument. An additional optional
 * {@code loadFactor} constructor argument provides a further means of
 * customizing initial table capacity by specifying the table density
 * to be used in calculating the amount of space to allocate for the
 * given number of elements.  Also, for compatibility with previous
 * versions of this class, constructors may optionally specify an
 * expected {@code concurrencyLevel} as an additional hint for
 * internal sizing.  Note that using many keys with exactly the same
 * {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow down performance of any
 * hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys are {@link Comparable},
 * this class may use comparison order among keys to help break ties.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Set} projection of a ConcurrentHashMap may be created
 * (using {@link #newKeySet()} or {@link #newKeySet(int)}), or viewed
 * (using {@link #keySet(Object)} when only keys are of interest, and the
 * mapped values are (perhaps transiently) not used or all take the
 * same mapping value.
 *
 * <p>A ConcurrentHashMap can be used as a scalable frequency map (a
 * form of histogram or multiset) by using {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder} values and initializing via
 * {@link #computeIfAbsent computeIfAbsent}. For example, to add a count
 * to a {@code ConcurrentHashMap<String,LongAdder> freqs}, you can use
 * {@code freqs.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new LongAdder()).increment();}
 *
 * <p>This class and its views and iterators implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator}
 * interfaces.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link Hashtable} but unlike {@link HashMap}, this class
 * does <em>not</em> allow {@code null} to be used as a key or value.
 *
 * <p>ConcurrentHashMaps support a set of sequential and parallel bulk
 * operations that, unlike most {@link Stream} methods, are designed
 * to be safely, and often sensibly, applied even with maps that are
 * being concurrently updated by other threads; for example, when
 * computing a snapshot summary of the values in a shared registry.
 * There are three kinds of operation, each with four forms, accepting
 * functions with keys, values, entries, and (key, value) pairs as
 * arguments and/or return values. Because the elements of a
 * ConcurrentHashMap are not ordered in any particular way, and may be
 * processed in different orders in different parallel executions, the
 * correctness of supplied functions should not depend on any
 * ordering, or on any other objects or values that may transiently
 * change while computation is in progress; and except for forEach
 * actions, should ideally be side-effect-free. Bulk operations on
 * {@link Map.Entry} objects do not support method {@code setValue}.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>forEach: Performs a given action on each element.
 * A variant form applies a given transformation on each element
 * before performing the action.
 *
 * <li>search: Returns the first available non-null result of
 * applying a given function on each element; skipping further
 * search when a result is found.
 *
 * <li>reduce: Accumulates each element.  The supplied reduction
 * function cannot rely on ordering (more formally, it should be
 * both associative and commutative).  There are five variants:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Plain reductions. (There is not a form of this method for
 * (key, value) function arguments since there is no corresponding
 * return type.)
 *
 * <li>Mapped reductions that accumulate the results of a given
 * function applied to each element.
 *
 * <li>Reductions to scalar doubles, longs, and ints, using a
 * given basis value.
 *
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These bulk operations accept a {@code parallelismThreshold}
 * argument. Methods proceed sequentially if the current map size is
 * estimated to be less than the given threshold. Using a value of
 * {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} suppresses all parallelism.  Using a value
 * of {@code 1} results in maximal parallelism by partitioning into
 * enough subtasks to fully utilize the {@link
 * ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} that is used for all parallel
 * computations. Normally, you would initially choose one of these
 * extreme values, and then measure performance of using in-between
 * values that trade off overhead versus throughput.
 *
 * <p>The concurrency properties of bulk operations follow
 * from those of ConcurrentHashMap: Any non-null result returned
 * from {@code get(key)} and related access methods bears a
 * happens-before relation with the associated insertion or
 * update.  The result of any bulk operation reflects the
 * composition of these per-element relations (but is not
 * necessarily atomic with respect to the map as a whole unless it
 * is somehow known to be quiescent).  Conversely, because keys
 * and values in the map are never null, null serves as a reliable
 * atomic indicator of the current lack of any result.  To
 * maintain this property, null serves as an implicit basis for
 * all non-scalar reduction operations. For the double, long, and
 * int versions, the basis should be one that, when combined with
 * any other value, returns that other value (more formally, it
 * should be the identity element for the reduction). Most common
 * reductions have these properties; for example, computing a sum
 * with basis 0 or a minimum with basis MAX_VALUE.
 *
 * <p>Search and transformation functions provided as arguments
 * should similarly return null to indicate the lack of any result
 * (in which case it is not used). In the case of mapped
 * reductions, this also enables transformations to serve as
 * filters, returning null (or, in the case of primitive
 * specializations, the identity basis) if the element should not
 * be combined. You can create compound transformations and
 * filterings by composing them yourself under this "null means
 * there is nothing there now" rule before using them in search or
 * reduce operations.
 *
 * <p>Methods accepting and/or returning Entry arguments maintain
 * key-value associations. They may be useful for example when
 * finding the key for the greatest value. Note that "plain" Entry
 * arguments can be supplied using {@code new
 * AbstractMap.SimpleEntry(k,v)}.
 *
 * <p>Bulk operations may complete abruptly, throwing an
 * exception encountered in the application of a supplied
 * function. Bear in mind when handling such exceptions that other
 * concurrently executing functions could also have thrown
 * exceptions, or would have done so if the first exception had
 * not occurred.
 *
 * <p>Speedups for parallel compared to sequential forms are common
 * but not guaranteed.  Parallel operations involving brief functions
 * on small maps may execute more slowly than sequential forms if the
 * underlying work to parallelize the computation is more expensive
 * than the computation itself.  Similarly, parallelization may not
 * lead to much actual parallelism if all processors are busy
 * performing unrelated tasks.
 *
 * <p>All arguments to all task methods must be non-null.

    /*
     * Overview:
     *
     * The primary design goal of this hash table is to maintain
     * concurrent readability (typically method get(), but also
     * iterators and related methods) while minimizing update
     * contention. Secondary goals are to keep space consumption about
     * the same or better than java.util.HashMap, and to support high
     * initial insertion rates on an empty table by many threads.
     *
     * This map usually acts as a binned (bucketed) hash table.  Each
     * key-value mapping is held in a Node.  Most nodes are instances
     * of the basic Node class with hash, key, value, and next
     * fields. However, various subclasses exist: TreeNodes are
     * arranged in balanced trees, not lists.  TreeBins hold the roots
     * of sets of TreeNodes. ForwardingNodes are placed at the heads
     * of bins during resizing. ReservationNodes are used as
     * placeholders while establishing values in computeIfAbsent and
     * related methods.  The types TreeBin, ForwardingNode, and
     * ReservationNode do not hold normal user keys, values, or
     * hashes, and are readily distinguishable during search etc
     * because they have negative hash fields and null key and value
     * fields. (These special nodes are either uncommon or transient,
     * so the impact of carrying around some unused fields is
     * insignificant.)
     *
     * The table is lazily initialized to a power-of-two size upon the
     * first insertion.  Each bin in the table normally contains a
     * list of Nodes (most often, the list has only zero or one Node).
     * Table accesses require volatile/atomic reads, writes, and
     * CASes.  Because there is no other way to arrange this without
     * adding further indirections, we use intrinsics
     * (jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe) operations.
     *
     * We use the top (sign) bit of Node hash fields for control
     * purposes -- it is available anyway because of addressing
     * constraints.  Nodes with negative hash fields are specially
     * handled or ignored in map methods.
     *
     * Insertion (via put or its variants) of the first node in an
     * empty bin is performed by just CASing it to the bin.  This is
     * by far the most common case for put operations under most
     * key/hash distributions.  Other update operations (insert,
     * delete, and replace) require locks.  We do not want to waste
     * the space required to associate a distinct lock object with
     * each bin, so instead use the first node of a bin list itself as
     * a lock. Locking support for these locks relies on builtin
     * "synchronized" monitors.
     *
     * Using the first node of a list as a lock does not by itself
     * suffice though: When a node is locked, any update must first
     * validate that it is still the first node after locking it, and
     * retry if not. Because new nodes are always appended to lists,
     * once a node is first in a bin, it remains first until deleted
     * or the bin becomes invalidated (upon resizing).
     *
     * The main disadvantage of per-bin locks is that other update
     * operations on other nodes in a bin list protected by the same
     * lock can stall, for example when user equals() or mapping
     * functions take a long time.  However, statistically, under
     * random hash codes, this is not a common problem.  Ideally, the
     * frequency of nodes in bins follows a Poisson distribution
     * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with a
     * parameter of about 0.5 on average, given the resizing threshold
     * of 0.75, although with a large variance because of resizing
     * granularity. Ignoring variance, the expected occurrences of
     * list size k are (exp(-0.5) * pow(0.5, k) / factorial(k)). The
     * first values are:
     *
     * 0:    0.60653066
     * 1:    0.30326533
     * 2:    0.07581633
     * 3:    0.01263606
     * 4:    0.00157952
     * 5:    0.00015795
     * 6:    0.00001316
     * 7:    0.00000094
     * 8:    0.00000006
     * more: less than 1 in ten million
     *
     * Lock contention probability for two threads accessing distinct
     * elements is roughly 1 / (8 * #elements) under random hashes.
     *
     * Actual hash code distributions encountered in practice
     * sometimes deviate significantly from uniform randomness.  This
     * includes the case when N > (1<<30), so some keys MUST collide.
     * Similarly for dumb or hostile usages in which multiple keys are
     * designed to have identical hash codes or ones that differs only
     * in masked-out high bits. So we use a secondary strategy that
     * applies when the number of nodes in a bin exceeds a
     * threshold. These TreeBins use a balanced tree to hold nodes (a
     * specialized form of red-black trees), bounding search time to
     * O(log N).  Each search step in a TreeBin is at least twice as
     * slow as in a regular list, but given that N cannot exceed
     * (1<<64) (before running out of addresses) this bounds search
     * steps, lock hold times, etc, to reasonable constants (roughly
     * 100 nodes inspected per operation worst case) so long as keys
     * are Comparable (which is very common -- String, Long, etc).
     * TreeBin nodes (TreeNodes) also maintain the same "next"
     * traversal pointers as regular nodes, so can be traversed in
     * iterators in the same way.
     *
     * The table is resized when occupancy exceeds a percentage
     * threshold (nominally, 0.75, but see below).  Any thread
     * noticing an overfull bin may assist in resizing after the
     * initiating thread allocates and sets up the replacement array.
     * However, rather than stalling, these other threads may proceed
     * with insertions etc.  The use of TreeBins shields us from the
     * worst case effects of overfilling while resizes are in
     * progress.  Resizing proceeds by transferring bins, one by one,
     * from the table to the next table. However, threads claim small
     * blocks of indices to transfer (via field transferIndex) before
     * doing so, reducing contention.  A generation stamp in field
     * sizeCtl ensures that resizings do not overlap. Because we are
     * using power-of-two expansion, the elements from each bin must
     * either stay at same index, or move with a power of two
     * offset. We eliminate unnecessary node creation by catching
     * cases where old nodes can be reused because their next fields
     * won't change.  On average, only about one-sixth of them need
     * cloning when a table doubles. The nodes they replace will be
     * garbage collectible as soon as they are no longer referenced by
     * any reader thread that may be in the midst of concurrently
     * traversing table.  Upon transfer, the old table bin contains
     * only a special forwarding node (with hash field "MOVED") that
     * contains the next table as its key. On encountering a
     * forwarding node, access and update operations restart, using
     * the new table.
     *
     * Each bin transfer requires its bin lock, which can stall
     * waiting for locks while resizing. However, because other
     * threads can join in and help resize rather than contend for
     * locks, average aggregate waits become shorter as resizing
     * progresses.  The transfer operation must also ensure that all
     * accessible bins in both the old and new table are usable by any
     * traversal.  This is arranged in part by proceeding from the
     * last bin (table.length - 1) up towards the first.  Upon seeing
     * a forwarding node, traversals (see class Traverser) arrange to
     * move to the new table without revisiting nodes.  To ensure that
     * no intervening nodes are skipped even when moved out of order,
     * a stack (see class TableStack) is created on first encounter of
     * a forwarding node during a traversal, to maintain its place if
     * later processing the current table. The need for these
     * save/restore mechanics is relatively rare, but when one
     * forwarding node is encountered, typically many more will be.
     * So Traversers use a simple caching scheme to avoid creating so
     * many new TableStack nodes. (Thanks to Peter Levart for
     * suggesting use of a stack here.)
     *
     * The traversal scheme also applies to partial traversals of
     * ranges of bins (via an alternate Traverser constructor)
     * to support partitioned aggregate operations.  Also, read-only
     * operations give up if ever forwarded to a null table, which
     * provides support for shutdown-style clearing, which is also not
     * currently implemented.
     *
     * Lazy table initialization minimizes footprint until first use,
     * and also avoids resizings when the first operation is from a
     * putAll, constructor with map argument, or deserialization.
     * These cases attempt to override the initial capacity settings,
     * but harmlessly fail to take effect in cases of races.
     *
     * The element count is maintained using a specialization of
     * LongAdder. We need to incorporate a specialization rather than
     * just use a LongAdder in order to access implicit
     * contention-sensing that leads to creation of multiple
     * CounterCells.  The counter mechanics avoid contention on
     * updates but can encounter cache thrashing if read too
     * frequently during concurrent access. To avoid reading so often,
     * resizing under contention is attempted only upon adding to a
     * bin already holding two or more nodes. Under uniform hash
     * distributions, the probability of this occurring at threshold
     * is around 13%, meaning that only about 1 in 8 puts check
     * threshold (and after resizing, many fewer do so).
     *
     * TreeBins use a special form of comparison for search and
     * related operations (which is the main reason we cannot use
     * existing collections such as TreeMaps). TreeBins contain
     * Comparable elements, but may contain others, as well as
     * elements that are Comparable but not necessarily Comparable for
     * the same T, so we cannot invoke compareTo among them. To handle
     * this, the tree is ordered primarily by hash value, then by
     * Comparable.compareTo order if applicable.  On lookup at a node,
     * if elements are not comparable or compare as 0 then both left
     * and right children may need to be searched in the case of tied
     * hash values. (This corresponds to the full list search that
     * would be necessary if all elements were non-Comparable and had
     * tied hashes.) On insertion, to keep a total ordering (or as
     * close as is required here) across rebalancings, we compare
     * classes and identityHashCodes as tie-breakers. The red-black
     * balancing code is updated from pre-jdk-collections
     * (http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/collections/RBCell.java)
     * based in turn on Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest "Introduction to
     * Algorithms" (CLR).
     *
     * TreeBins also require an additional locking mechanism.  While
     * list traversal is always possible by readers even during
     * updates, tree traversal is not, mainly because of tree-rotations
     * that may change the root node and/or its linkages.  TreeBins
     * include a simple read-write lock mechanism parasitic on the
     * main bin-synchronization strategy: Structural adjustments
     * associated with an insertion or removal are already bin-locked
     * (and so cannot conflict with other writers) but must wait for
     * ongoing readers to finish. Since there can be only one such
     * waiter, we use a simple scheme using a single "waiter" field to
     * block writers.  However, readers need never block.  If the root
     * lock is held, they proceed along the slow traversal path (via
     * next-pointers) until the lock becomes available or the list is
     * exhausted, whichever comes first. These cases are not fast, but
     * maximize aggregate expected throughput.
     *
     * Maintaining API and serialization compatibility with previous
     * versions of this class introduces several oddities. Mainly: We
     * leave untouched but unused constructor arguments referring to
     * concurrencyLevel. We accept a loadFactor constructor argument,
     * but apply it only to initial table capacity (which is the only
     * time that we can guarantee to honor it.) We also declare an
     * unused "Segment" class that is instantiated in minimal form
     * only when serializing.
     *
     * Also, solely for compatibility with previous versions of this
     * class, it extends AbstractMap, even though all of its methods
     * are overridden, so it is just useless baggage.
     *
     * This file is organized to make things a little easier to follow
     * while reading than they might otherwise: First the main static
     * declarations and utilities, then fields, then main public
     * methods (with a few factorings of multiple public methods into
     * internal ones), then sizing methods, trees, traversers, and
     * bulk operations.
