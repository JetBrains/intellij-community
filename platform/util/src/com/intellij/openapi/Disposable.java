/**
 * A marker for classes that require some work done for cleaning up.
 * To do that,
 * <ul>
 * <li>implement this interface. Please avoid using lambdas or method references because each Disposable instance needs identity to be stored in the Disposer hierarchy correctly</li>
 * <li>override the {@link #dispose()} method in your implementation and place your cleanup logic there</li>
 * <li>register the instance in {@link Disposer}</li>
 * </ul>
 * After that, when the parent {@link Disposable} object is disposed (e.g., the project is closed or a window hidden), the {@link #dispose()} method in your implementation will be called automatically by the platform.
 * <p>
 * As a general policy, you shouldn't call the {@link #dispose()} method directly,
 * Instead, register your object in the {@link Disposer} hierarchy of disposable objects via
 * {@link Disposer#register(Disposable, Disposable)} to be automatically disposed along with the the parent object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're 100% sure that you should control your object's disposal manually,
 * do not call the {@link #dispose()} method either.
 * Use {@link Disposer#dispose(Disposable)} instead, since there might be objects registered in the chain
 * that need to be cleaned up before your object.
 * </p>
