/**
 * This interface provides a base support for the {@link XMLOutputter2}.
 * <p>
 * People who want to create a custom XMLOutputProcessor for XMLOutputter are
 * able to implement this interface with the following notes and restrictions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The XMLOutputter will call one, and only one of the <code>process(Writer,Format,*)</code> methods each
 * time the XMLOutputter is requested to output some JDOM content. It is thus
 * safe to assume that a <code>process(Writer,Format,*)</code> method can set up any
 * infrastructure needed to process the content, and that the XMLOutputter will
 * not re-call that method, or some other <code>process(Writer,Format,*)</code> method for the same output
 * sequence.
 * <li>The process methods should be thread-safe and reentrant: The same
 * <code>process(Writer,Format,*)</code> method may (will) be called concurrently from different threads.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The {@link XmlOutputProcessorImpl} class is a full implementation of this
 * interface and is fully customisable. People who want a custom XMLOutputter
 * are encouraged to extend the AbstractXMLOutputProcessor rather than do a full
 * re-implementation of this interface.
