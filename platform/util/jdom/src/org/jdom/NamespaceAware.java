/**
 * Classes implementing this interface are all sensitive to their
 * {@link Namespace} context. All the core JDOM classes are NamespaceAware
 * ({@link Parent} and subtypes, {@link Content} and subtypes, and
 * {@link Attribute}). You can use the methods that this interface provides
 * to query the Namespace context.
 * <p>
 * JDOM2 introduces a consistency in reporting Namespace context. XML standards
 * do not dictate any conditions on Namespace reporting or ordering, but
 * consistency is valuable for user-friendliness. As a result JDOM2 imposes a
 * useful order on the Namespace context for XML content.
 * <p>
 * The order for Namespace reporting is:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the item 'has' a Namespace (Element, Attribute) then that Namespace is
 * reported.
 * <li>The remaining Namespaces are reported in alphabetical order by prefix.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The XML namespace (bound to the prefix "xml" - see
 * {@link Namespace#XML_NAMESPACE} ) is always in every scope. It is always
 * introduced in {@link Document}, and in all other NamespaceAware instances it
 * is introduced if that content is detached.
 * <p>
 * See the individualised documentation for each implementing type for
 * additional specific details. The following section is a description of how
 * Namespaces are managed in the Element class.
 * <p>
 * <h2>The Element Namespace Scope</h2>
 * The 'default' Namespace is a source of confusion, but it is simply the
 * Namespace which is in-scope for an Element that has no Namespace prefix
 * (prefix is "" but it could have any Namespace URI). There will always be
 * exactly one Namespace that is in-scope for an element that has no prefix.
 * <p>
 * All Elements are in a Namespace. Elements will be in
 * {@link Namespace#NO_NAMESPACE} unless a different Namespace was supplied as
 * part of the Element Constructor, or later modified by the
 * {@link Element#setNamespace(Namespace)} method.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the Element's Namespace, there could be other Namespaces that
 * are 'in scope' for the Element. The set of Namespaces that are in scope for
 * an Element is the union of five sets:
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th valign="top">XML</th>
 *     <td>
 *       There is always exactly one member of this set,
 *       {@link Namespace#XML_NAMESPACE}.
 *       <br>
 *       This set cannot be changed.
 *     </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th valign="top">Element</th>
 *     <td>
 *       There is always exactly one member of this set, and it can be retrieved
 *       or set with the methods {@link Element#getNamespace()} and
 *       {@link Element#setNamespace(Namespace)} respectively.
 *     </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th valign="top">Attribute</th>
 *     <td>
 *       This is the set of distinct Namespaces that are used on Attributes. You
 *       can modify the set by adding and removing Attributes to the Element.
 * <p>
 *       <b>NOTE:</b>
 *       The {@link Namespace#NO_NAMESPACE Namespace.NO_NAMESPACE} Namespace is always the
 *       <i>default</i> Namespace for attributes (the Namespace that has no
 *       prefix). Thus there may be a special case with this Namespace, because
 *       if there is a different <i>default</i> Namespace for the Element, then
 *       the Namespace.NO_NAMESPACE Namespace is not part of the Element's in-scope
 *       Namespace set (the Element cannot have two Namespaces in scope with the
 *       same prefix - "").
 *     </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th valign="top">Additional</th>
 *     <td>
 *       This set is maintained by the two methods {@link Element#addNamespaceDeclaration(Namespace)}
 *       and {@link Element#removeNamespaceDeclaration(Namespace)}. You can get the full set
 *       of additional Namespaces with {@link Element#getAdditionalNamespaces()}
 *     </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th valign="top">Inherited</th>
 *     <td>
 *       This last set is somewhat dynamic because only those Namespaces on the
 *       parent Element which are not re-defined by this Element will be
 *       inherited. A Namespace is redefined by setting a new Namespace with the
 *       same prefix, but a different URI. If you set a Namespace on the Element
 *       (or add a Namespace declaration or set an Attribute) with the same
 *       prefix as another Namespace that would have been otherwise inherited,
 *       then that other Namespace will no longer be inherited.
 *     </td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since you cannot change the Namespace.XML_NAMESPACE, and the 'inherited' Namespace set
 * is dynamic, the remaining Namespace sets are the most interesting from a JDOM
 * perspective. JDOM validates all modifications that affect the Namespaces in
 * scope for an Element. An IllegalAddException will be thrown if you attempt to
 * add a new Namespace to the in-scope set if a different Namespace with the
 * same prefix is already part of one of these three sets (Element, Attribute,
 * or Additional).
