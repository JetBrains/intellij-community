/**
 * The IDE supports two different HiDPI modes:
 *
 * 1) IDE-managed HiDPI mode.
 * Supported for backward compatibility until complete transition to the JRE-managed HiDPI mode happens.
 * In this mode there's a single coordinate space, and the whole UI is scaled by the IDE guided by the user scale factor ([USR_SCALE]).
 *
 * 2) JRE-managed HiDPI mode.
 * In this mode the JRE scales graphics prior to drawing it on the device.
 * So, there are two coordinate spaces: the user space and the device space.
 * The system scale factor ([SYS_SCALE]) defines the transform b/w the spaces.
 * The UI size metrics (windows, controls, fonts height) are in the user coordinate space.
 * Though, the raster images should be aware of the device scale in order to meet HiDPI.
 * (For instance, JRE on a Mac Retina monitor device works in the JRE-managed HiDPI mode,
 * transforming graphics to the double-scaled device coordinate space)
 *
 * The IDE operates the scale factors of the following types:
 * 1) The user scale factor: [USR_SCALE]
 * 2) The system (monitor device) scale factor: [SYS_SCALE]
 * 3) The object (UI instance specific) scale factor: [OBJ_SCALE]

   * The user scale factor is set and managed by the IDE.
   * Currently, it's derived from the UI font size, specified in the IDE Settings.
   *
   * The user scale value depends on which HiDPI mode is enabled.
   * In the IDE-managed HiDPI mode the user scale "includes" the default system scale and simply equals it with the default UI font size.
   * In the JRE-managed HiDPI mode the user scale is independent of the system scale and equals 1.0 with the default UI font size.
   * In case the default UI font size changes, the user scale changes proportionally in both the HiDPI modes.
   *
   * In the IDE-managed HiDPI mode the user scale completely defines the UI scale.
   * In the JRE-managed HiDPI mode the user scale can be considered a supplementary scale taking effect in cases like
   * the IDE Presentation Mode and when the default UI scale is changed by the user.
