/**
 * This is primarily intended to be used by the service implementation. When introducing a new service,
 * please add a static `getInstance()` method. For better tooling performance, it is always advised
 * to keep an explicit method return type.
 *
 *     @Service
 *     class MyApplicationService {
 *       companion object {
 *         @JvmStatic
 *         fun getInstance(): MyApplicationService = service()
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * Using a `getInstance()` method is preferred over a property, because:
 *
 *   - It makes it more clear on the call site that it can involve loading the service, which might not be cheap.
 *
 *   - Loading the service can throw an exception, and having an exception thrown by a method call is less surprising
 *     than if it was caused by property access.
 *
 *   - (Over-)using properties may be error-prone in a way that it might be accidentally changed to a property with an initializer
 *     instead of the correct (but more verbose) property with a getter, and that change can easily be overlooked.
 *
 *   - Using the method instead of a property keeps `MyApplicationService.getInstance()` calls consistent
 *     when used both in Kotlin, and Java.
 *
 *   - Using the method keeps `MyApplicationService.getInstance()` consistent with `MyProjectService.getInstance(project)`,
 *     both on the declaration and call sites.
