/**
 * Defines a listener for changes that occur in the [WorkspaceFileIndex].
 *
 * It sends two sets of [WorkspaceFileSet], deleted and added.
 * It also sends two [EntityStorage] before and after the changes.
 * This is necessary because it is expected to resolve [com.intellij.platform.workspace.storage.EntityPointer] of the deleted [WorkspaceFileSet]
 * in storageBefore and [com.intellij.platform.workspace.storage.EntityPointer] of the registered [WorkspaceFileSet] in storageAfter.
 * However, note that [WorkspaceFileIndex] itself is not versioned, so it is not guaranteed that the deleted or added [WorkspaceFileSet] will
 * be present in [WorkspaceFileIndex].
 *
 * The listener is called inside Write Action, but processing this event in Write Action may lead to unexpected results.
