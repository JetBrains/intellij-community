    <h2 id="why-we-collect-data">Why We Collect Data</h2>

    <p>We collect data for various reasons, such as:</p>

    <ul class="circlelist">
        <li><strong>To provide you with software, services or information.</strong> We may collect data that
            identifies you as an individual or company, which is required to provide you with the software,
            support, and services that you have requested. To receive the software, support and services,
            you explicitly fill in the data, whether you purchase a JetBrains Downloadable Software Product,
            purchase JetBrains Software as a Service, use our support forums, sign up for a JetBrains
            Account, register for a webinar, participate in a survey, and/or subscribe to receive marketing
            and/or technical information and content. We may use third-party service providers to assist us
            in provisioning our services to you or in our operations. For example, we may use third party
            service providers to provide data storage and backup services.
        </li>
        <li><strong>To check for license validation and updates.</strong> Some JetBrains Downloadable
            Software Products regularly check for software updates and/or license validation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>To improve our offerings based on usage.</strong> We collect data based on your use of
            our products and services, and we do not associate this data with your name. We use this data to
            better understand usage patterns of our products and behavior of our collective audience. At
            times we may share this information in aggregated anonymous form with third parties. Collection
            of data based on your use of JetBrains Downloadable Software Products is done only if you permit
            it.
        </li>
        <li><strong>To promote and market our products.</strong> We may use feedback that you provide
            voluntarily on our products or services. As permitted by applicable law, we may use this in the
            form of quotes or in other ways in accordance with the JetBrains Terms of Use. We also may use
            data that we collect and aggregate to assist us in determining appropriate marketing and
            advertising for our products and services. In doing so, we may share aggregate data with third
            parties to assist us with these efforts. We also may use third party service providers to assist
            us with our email marketing; in that case, the third party service provider will have access to
            your email address, your name, and other information necessary to engage in the marketing.
        </li>
        <li><strong>To provide technical support.</strong> We may need to ask you for data to process your
            support request, especially if it requires accessing your account or other data that you already
            have provided to us. We may have to access and/or request a failure code, which may contain
            personal data of the user who reported the failure. You hereby expressly consent to the
            collection and storage of this data.
        </li>
        <li><strong>As required by law.</strong> We may use and disclose your personal data where required
            by law, such as in response to a court order, valid subpoena, or other legal process.
        </li>
        <li><strong>To protect our rights and interests and the rights and interests of other
            users.</strong> We may use and disclose your personal data where we believe, in our sole
            judgment, that it is appropriate to do so to protect our rights and interests and the rights and
            interests of other users of JetBrains Software Products or services, or where we believe there
            has been a violation of this privacy policy that could affect the interests of JetBrains or its
            customers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If we are acquired by or merged with another entity, if
            substantially all of our assets are transferred to another entity, or as part of a bankruptcy
            proceeding, or other business transfer, we may transfer the information we have collected from
            or about you to the other entity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We use third party service providers as
            discussed in this section. We also use third party service providers in other circumstances; a
            complete list of the reasons in which we use third party service providers can be found <a
                    href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/Privacy+Policy">here</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="what-we-collect">What We Collect</h2>
    <p>What we collect depends largely on the interaction that takes place between you and JetBrains, most
        of which can be categorized under the following:</p>

    <h4><em>Purchasing JetBrains Software Products</em></h4>
    <p>When you purchase a JetBrains Downloadable Software Product or sign up for JetBrains Software as a
        Service, we collect information to process your payment and create your customer account. This
        information includes name, email address, physical address, telephone number, and company name where
        applicable. We retain the last four digits of your credit card to allow you to identify the card
        used for future purchases. We use a third-party service provider to process your credit card
        transactions. These third parties are governed by their own agreements, which can be found on
        Jetbrains.com under the section <a
                href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/Privacy+Policy">Third-Party Services</a>.</p>

    <h4><em>Using JetBrains Downloadable Software Products</em></h4>
    <p>When downloading and installing purchased software, you need to provide the software with
        identifiable information such as your JetBrains Account or Licensing information. On installation
        and execution, the software may send JetBrains certain information, including product version,
        product edition, and information about the operating system and/or environment where the product is
        installed, applicable to tools such as ReSharper™, which is a plugin to Visual Studio™. A unique,
        randomly-generated ID, which does not contain any license or other personally identifiable
        information, is also used to distinguish instances. The software can also check for available
        updates, as well as available updates for plugins or components. In addition it can check for
        license validation, either using the license key or your JetBrains Account details. Some software
        products can also use license information to inform you of the availability of applicable
        updates.</p>

    <p>If you opt in to anonymous data collection through the software product (which is distinct from data
        collection on the website through cookies and other tracking technologies, as discussed below), the
        software may electronically send information to JetBrains related to your usage of the application’s
        features. This information may include, but is not limited to, frameworks, file templates being used
        in the IDEs, actions invoked, and other interactions with product features. This information will
        contain neither source code nor your name, nor information about your JetBrains Account or Licensing
        information.</p>

    <h4><em>Using JetBrains Software as a Service</em></h4>
    <p>When you use any JetBrains Software as a Service, we store all the content you provide, including but
        not limited to accounts created for team members, files, pictures, project information, and any
        other information that you provide to the services you use. These services can include YouTrack,
        TeamCity, Upsource, or any other software as a service that JetBrains provides or could potentially
        provide in the future.</p>

    <p>For any JetBrains Software as a Service, we also collect data about usage of the software. This may
        include, but is not limited to, numbers of users and groups, types of projects, numbers of projects,
        frequency and usage of attachments, searches performed, actions invoked in the product and other
        interactions with product features.</p>

    <p>In addition, weblogs that may be generated during your use of JetBrains Software as a Service may
        include information about IP addresses used to access the service, browser, operating environment,
        URL’s used to access the service, or other information. This information may be analyzed for
        security and auditing purposes.</p>

    <h4><em>Signing up for Webinars, Newsletters and/or Marketing Material</em></h4>

    <p>When you sign up for webinars, newsletters and/or other marketing materials, we collect information about
        you. This includes personal details such as name, email address, company name and possibly other
        information relevant to the offerings, such as technology interests.</p>

    <h4><em>User Generated Content</em></h4>

    <p>Our products and services often give you the option to provide feedback, such as suggestions, compliments
        or problems encountered. We invite you to provide such feedback as well as to participate with comments
        on our blogs and discussion forums. If you choose to post a comment, your user name, city, and any other
        information that you choose to post will be visible to the public. We are not responsible for the
        privacy of any information that you choose to post to our website, including in our blogs, or for the
        accuracy of any information contained in those postings. Any information that you disclose becomes
        public information. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this
        Policy, the law or your personal privacy.</p>

    <h2 id="using-website">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

    <p>We, and our third party service providers, use cookies and other tracking technologies on our Website and
        client portals (collectively our “Website”). We use these tools to identify you when you visit our
        Website, to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Website, to improve our Website and
        the services that we provide, for analytics purposes, for targeted advertising, and as discussed in this
        section.</p>

    <h4>Your Consent/Withdrawing Consent</h4>

    <p>By continuing to use our Website, you are agreeing to the placement of cookies on your computer by us and
        our third party service providers. You may withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

    <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of this Website, you must stop using our
        Website and disable cookies via your browser settings for this Website or globally (see below). You also
        may opt out of targeted advertising at any time by visiting <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/optout/">www.jetbrains.com/optout/</a>.
        Please note that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of our Website, and may prevent you
        from being able to access certain features on our Website. For further information about deleting or
        blocking cookies, please visit: <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies">http://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies/</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>The Technologies we Use</h4>

    <p><strong><em>Cookies.</em></strong> A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your
        browser or the hard drive of your computer. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it
        will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our Website. There are two types
        of cookies:</p>

    <ul class="circlelist">
        <li><strong><em>Persistent cookies:</em></strong> these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period
            of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that
            created that particular cookie.
        </li>
        <li><strong><em>Session cookies:</em></strong> these cookies allow website operators to link the actions
            of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window
            and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you
            close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</em></strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics
        with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on
        your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs
        (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other things,
        track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website
        usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to
        help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our emails
        are forwarded.</p>

    <h4><em>First and third-party cookies</em></h4>

    <p>In relation to whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain placing the cookie.</p>

    <p><em>First-party cookies</em> are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time
        (e.g., cookies placed by us). Cookies placed by JetBrains are used when creating an account, identifying
        yourself using JetBrains Account, purchasing products using the e-store, as well as using any of our
        services, including but not limited to, our issue tracker, blogs and discussions forums, newsletter
        sign-up, etc. At times we may also use cookies for testing out new features of our web site and/or
        services to a subset of our audience.</p>

    <p><em>Third-party cookies</em> are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being
        visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website,
        this would be a third-party cookie.</p>

    <h4>How to delete and block our cookies</h4>

    <p>You block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all
        or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential
        cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser
        setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our site.</p>

    <h4><em>Changing your cookie settings</em></h4>

    <p>Please note that internet browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings are usually
        found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your internet browser. In order to understand these
        settings, the following links may be helpful. Otherwise you should use the 'Help' option in your
        internet browser for more details.</p>

    <p><strong><em>'Performance'</em></strong> cookies collect information about how you use our Website e.g.

        that could identify you and are only used to help us improve how our Website works, understand what
        interests our users and measure the effectiveness of our advertising. We use performance cookies to:</p>

    <ul class="circlelist">

        use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above.</p>

    <p>By using our Website, or expressing your consent as otherwise required by applicable law, you accept the
        use of 'Performance' cookies. If you prevent cookies, we cannot guarantee how our Website will perform
        for you.</p>

    <p><strong><em>'Functionality' cookies</em></strong> are used to provide services or to remember settings to
        improve your visit. We use 'Functionality' cookies for such purposes as:</p>

    <ul class="circlelist">
        <li>Remember settings you've applied such as layout, text size, language, preferences and colors</li>
        <li>Remember if we've already asked you if you want to fill in a survey</li>
        <li>Remember if you have engaged with a particular component or product list on the Website so that
            don’t show it again
        </li>
        <li>Show you when you're logged in to the Website</li>
        <li>To provide and show embedded video content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties. We do not allow the third party to use the
        cookies for any purpose other than those listed above.</p>

    <p><strong><em>'Targeting' cookies</em></strong> are used to track your visit to our Website and other
        websites, including the pages you have visited and the links you have followed, which allows third
        parties to display targeted ads to you on the websites you visit.</p>

    <p>We and our third party service providers use <em>Targeting cookies</em> to:</p>

    <ul class="circlelist">
        <li>Link to social networks, like Facebook, that may subsequently use information about your visit to
            our website in order to provide advertising or other offers that may be of interest to you when you
            visit other websites.
        </li>
        <li>Provide third parties with information on your visit so that they can present you with
            advertisements or other offers that may be of interest to you.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are in the EU, you may opt-out of certain third party cookies that we and other websites may use
        for targeting through <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> or
        <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a>. Opting out of one or more ad networks only
        means that those particular members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not
        mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other third party
        websites. If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced
        opt-out pages, and you later erase your cookies, use a different computer or change Web browsers, your
        preference may no longer be active. Since all of these cookies are managed by third parties, you should
        refer to the third parties' own website privacy notifications and policies for further information (see
        below for more information about the particular targeting cookies used on our Website).</p>

    <p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the
        Digital Advertising Alliance (&laquo;DAA&raquo;) <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer
            Choice Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices
        regarding having information used by <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/participating/">DAA companies</a>.
        You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (&laquo;NAI&raquo;) <a
                href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for information about
        opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by <a
                href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks">NAI members</a>.</p>

    <p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer
        Choice Page</a> or the NAI <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out
        Page</a> will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it
        does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Website or on other websites. You
        may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are
        viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you
        opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is
        available on the DAA’s website at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a> or the NAI’s
