    <h2>3. GRANT OF RIGHTS</h2>

    <p>
        3.1. The Product is provided to Product Holder on a ‘per user’ basis, where Product Holder must assign a
        Subscription to a specific User who may deploy the Product on multiple Machines in accordance with the Product
        documentation. If the Product is accessed via a Floating License Server (as described in Section 6.3), the
        Product is provided to User on a ‘per machine’ basis, where the Floating License Server allocates the
        Subscription to a specific Machine that can only be used by one User at a time. If Product Holder and User
        comply with the terms of this Agreement, JetBrains grants to Product Holder and User the rights set out in this
        Section 3 to the extent necessary to enable Product Holder and User to effectively use the Product. All other
        rights remain reserved by JetBrains.
    </p>

    <p>
        3.2. Unless the Subscription has expired or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 13, and
        subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement, JetBrains grants you the non-exclusive and
        non-transferable right to use each Product covered by the Subscription as stipulated below:
    </p>
    <p>
        (A) You may:
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) install and use any version of the Product covered by the Subscription on any operating system supported by
        the Product; and
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) make one copy of the Product solely for archival, security, and/or backup purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        (B) You may not:
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) allow the same Subscription to be used concurrently by more than one (1) User, unless the Product is
        provided to Product Holder via a Floating License Server as specified in Section 6.3(C);
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, distribute, sell, or transfer the
        Product;
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) provide a third party with access to the Product or your JetBrains Account, or the right to use the
        Product;
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, or make any attempt to discover the source
        code of, the Product; or
    </p>
    <p>
        (v) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Product.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.3. Section 3.2 also applies to Products not covered by the Subscription, with the exception of 3.2(B)(i);
        provided, that for Products governed by their own specific agreements or terms of use, those shall take
        precedence over this Agreement to the extent of any conflict or discrepancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.4. Following the expiration of this Agreement, you may be granted access to the Fallback Version of a Product
        covered by the Subscription of the Product Holder. In that case, the rights stipulated in Section 3.1(A) shall
        continue on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and non-transferable basis for the continued use of a
        Fallback Version of each Product covered by the Subscription. The limitations set forth in Section 3.1(B) of
        this Agreement apply to the usage of the Fallback Version, as does Section 13.5. The rights granted in this
        Section 3.4 are expressly contingent upon User not being in breach of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.5. JetBrains has and retains all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in
        and to the Products, any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of
        the Products, including without limitation as they may incorporate Feedback (as defined below).
    </p>
    <p>
        3.6. If an independent module of the Product or the Product as a whole is a Redistributable Product, the
        following provisions shall apply in addition to Sections 3.1-3.5:
    </p>
    <p>
        (A) You may:
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) use the Redistributable Product without quantitative restrictions unless specified otherwise in the terms
        relating to the use of the particular Redistributable Product;
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) transfer, reproduce, redistribute, and provide access to the Redistributable Product to a third party;
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) sell your product containing or using the Redistributable Product to a third party, but not the
        Redistributable Product on its own;
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) redistribute the Redistributable Product onto another Machine for legitimate purposes in accordance with
        this Agreement and applicable law, and use the Redistributable Product on that Machine, provided that you have
        received authorization from the owner of that Machine to deploy and use the Redistributable Product in this way.
        You will indemnify JetBrains against any losses, costs, or damages arising from your deployment of the
        Redistributable Product onto another Machine in violation of this Section.
    </p>
    <p>
        (B) You agree that any Redistributable Product you reproduce, redistribute, or provide a third party access to
        must be governed by an agreement concluded between the relevant third party as a User and JetBrains and that the
        third party must be bound by that agreement prior to the use of the reproduced or redistributed Redistributable
        Product. JetBrains is the exclusive owner and licensor of the Redistributable Product. You acknowledge that you
        are liable to JetBrains for any loss or damages in connection with any breach of this Section.
    </p>
    <h2>4. DECOMPILING RESTRICTIONS</h2>

    <p>
        Some of the Products may include decompiling functionality that enables reproducing source code from the
        original binary code. You acknowledge that binary code and source code may be protected by copyright and

    <p>
        (ii) in your JetBrains Account; or

        (C) We respect that you may not agree to the updated Agreement. If that is the case, you can terminate your
        Subscription any time up to 30 days after the effective date of the updated Agreement. Termination according to

    </p>
    <p>
        (D) If you are using a Fallback Version and object to the update to the Agreement, you can continue using the

        Czech Republic, by three arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of that Arbitration Court, and the language of
        the proceedings will be English; if you are a consumer, we both agree that any Dispute-related litigation may
        only be brought in, and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of, any competent court of the Czech Republic,
        unless provided otherwise by applicable consumer law. Consumer Disputes can also be settled out of court through
