   * <p>Factory class for creating panels of components. There are two different types of panels.</p>
   *
   * <p>1) Component panel. It's essentially a <code>JComponent</code> that can be decorated with:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>&nbsp;a label that's located on the right of the component</li>
   *   <li>&nbsp;a help context label that's located on the left or below of the component</li>
   *   <li>&nbsp;an icon with a question mark that show a popup with more information which is show on the left</li>
   * </ul>
   * For more information see {@link ComponentPanelBuilder}</p>
   *
   * <p>2) ProgressBar panel. A panel containing <code>JProgressBar</code> that has specific layout
   * which is different from an arbitrary component panel. A progress bar panel can contain following items:
   * <ul>
   *   <li>&nbsp;a label that' located above or on the left of the progress bar</li>
   *   <li>&nbsp;a comment label that's located below the progress bar</li>
   *   <li>&nbsp;Cancel, Play, Pause buttons with assignable actions</li>
   * </ul>
   * For more information see {@link ProgressPanelBuilder}</p>
   *
   * <p>Either of the mentioned panels can be grouped together in a grid. I.e. it's possible to create a grid of
   * panels see {@link #grid()}.
   * When using grid internal implementation makes sure all labels (if the are placed on the left) are located
   * in the leftmost column and components/progress bars are in the second column expanding horizontally.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>{@link PanelGridBuilder} has convenient {@link PanelGridBuilder#resize()} method that allows rows to expand
   * vertically when the grid is resized. By default all rows stick to the top of the grid and all available empty space is
   * expanded below rows.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>For concrete examples look <code>ComponentPanelTestAction</code> test action and class.</p>
