/**
 * Project warm-up is a set of activities that help to prepare an IDE for being opened in a "ready-to-work" state.
 * This class allows to configure different processes that the IDE needs in order to successfully and completely open the required projects.
 * Typical examples of the clients of this API are build systems (Maven, Gradle) and SDK detectors (Python SDK, JDK).
