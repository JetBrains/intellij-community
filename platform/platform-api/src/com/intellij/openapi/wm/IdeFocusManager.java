/**
 * This class receives focus requests, manages the, and delegates to the awt focus subsystem. All focus requests
 * should be done through this class. For example, to request focus on a component:
 * <pre>
 *   IdeFocusManager.getInstance(project).requestFocus(comp, true);
 * </pre>
 * This is the preferred way to request focus on components to
 * <pre>
 *   comp.requestFocus();

 * This class is also responsible for delivering key events while focus transferring is in progress.
 * <p>
 * <code>IdeFocusManager</code> instance can be received per project or the global instance. The preferred way is
 * to use instance <code>IdeFocusManager.getInstance(project)</code>. If no project instance is available, then
 * <code>IdeFocusManager.getGlobalInstance()</code> can be used.
