 * The progress dialog is not shown in the UI immediately to avoid flickering,
 * i.e. the user won't see anything if the [action] completes within the given timeout.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 * **Important**: the [action] is run with [Dispatchers.Default][kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers.Default].
 *
 * Switches to [Dispatchers.EDT][com.intellij.openapi.application.EDT] are allowed inside the action,
 * as they are automatically scheduled with the correct modality, which is the newly entered one.
 *
 * ### Difference with [withModalProgress].
 *
 * This method blocks the caller and doesn't return until the [action] is completed.
 * Runnables, scheduled by various `invokeLater` calls within the given modality, are processed by the nested event loop.
 *
 * Usually the usage look like this:
 * ```
 * // on EDT
 * fun actionPerformed() {
 *
 *   // this will schedule a new coroutine in default dispatcher
 *   myCoroutineScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
 *
 *     // the coroutine will schedule modal action,
 *     // which will enter the modality some time later
 *     withModalProgress(...) {
 *
 *       // continue execution on Dispatchers.Default
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * [withModalProgressBlocking] is designed for cases when the caller requires the modality,
 * and the caller cannot afford to let go of the current EDT event:
 * ```
 * // on EDT
 * fun actionPerformed() {
 *
 *   // will enter the new modality synchronously in the current EDT event
 *   withModalProgressBlocking(...) {
 *
 *     // continue execution on Dispatchers.Default
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param owner in which frame the progress should be shown
 * @param cancellation controls the UI appearance, e.g. [TaskCancellation.nonCancellable] or [TaskCancellation.cancellable]
 * @throws ProcessCanceledException if the calling coroutine was cancelled,
 * or if the indicator was cancelled by the user in the UI
