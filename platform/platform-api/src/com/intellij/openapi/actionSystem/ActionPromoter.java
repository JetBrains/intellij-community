 * It's allowed to assign multiple actions to the same keyboard shortcut. Actions system filters them on the current
 * context basis during processing (e.g., we can have two actions assigned to the same shortcut, but one of them is
 * configured to be inapplicable in modal dialog context).
 * <p/>
 * However, there is a possible case that more than one action is applicable for a particular keyboard shortcut
 * after filtering. The first one is executed then. Hence, action processing order becomes very important.
 * <p/>
 * The current extension point allows specifying custom action sorter to use, if any. I.e., every component can define its custom
 * sorting rule to define priorities for target actions (classes of actions).
 * <p/>
 * If {@link AnAction} implements {@link ActionPromoter}, promoter would be used to rearrange this action (no need to register additionally as extension point)
