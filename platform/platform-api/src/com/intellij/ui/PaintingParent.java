/**
 * Used for deferred re-painting (i.e. for deferred icons). As a paint() method
 * is invoked through the normal AWT painting cycle, deferred painting of
 * children may be queued. It means that actual data used for painting is pushed
 * for calculation and, as it gets ready, there is need for repaint.
 *
 * The target component for further repaint() is either the component that was
 * originally exposed to painting or, if it's no longer showing (in case of a flyweight
 * renderer) -- the first component up in the hierarchy that implements PaintingParent.
