 * Currently we want to send completion related data from both EAP users and users with installed <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8117-completion-stats-collector">plugin</a>
 * In order to do that collecting is bundled into platform as a "Stats Collector" plugin, while being removed from "Completion Stats Collector" plugin.
 * This extension point allows non-bundled <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8117-completion-stats-collector">plugin</a> plugin to enable logging for non-EAP users.

 * INTERNAL USE ONLY
