    //RC: Mental model behind VFS initialization:
    //   VFS consists of few different storages: records, attributes, content... Each storage has its own on-disk
    //   data format. Each storage also has a writeable header field .version, which is (must be) 0 by default.
    //   VFS as a whole defines 'implementation version' (currentImplVersion) which is the overall on-disk data
    //   format known to current VFS code.
    //
    //   When VFS is initialized from scratch, this 'VFS impl version' is stamped into each storage .version header field.
    //   When VFS is loaded (from already existing on-disk representation), we load each storage from apt file(s), collect
    //   all the storage.versions and check them against currentImplVersion -- and if all the versions are equal to
    //   currentImplVersion => VFS is OK and ready to use ('success path')
    //
    //   If not all versions are equal to currentImplVersion => we assume VFS is outdated, drop all the VFS files, and throw
    //   exception, which most likely triggers VFS rebuild from 0 somewhere above.
    //   Now, versions could be != currentImplVersion for different reasons:
    //   1) On-disk VFS are of an ancient version -- the most obvious reason
    //   2) Some of the VFS storages are missed on disk, and initialized from 0, thus having their .version=0
    //   3) Some of the VFS storages have an unrecognizable on-disk format (e.g. corrupted) -- in this case
    //      specific storage implementation could either
    //      a) re-create storage from 0 => will have .version=0, see branch #2
    //      b) throw an exception => will be caught, and VFS files will be all dropped,
    //                               and likely lead to VFS rebuild from 0 somewhere upper the callstack
    //   So the simple condition (all storages .version must be == currentImplVersion) actually covers a set of different cases
    //   which is convenient.
    //
    //MAYBE RC: Current model has important drawback: it is all-or-nothing, i.e. even a minor change in VFS on-disk format requires
    //          full VFS rebuild. VFS rebuild itself is not so costly -- but it invalidates all fileIds, which causes Indexes rebuild,
    //          which IS costly.
    //          It would be nicer if VFS be able to just 'upgrade' a minor change in format to a newer version, without full rebuild
    //          -- but with the current approach such functionality, it is hard to plug in.
    //          Sketch of a better implementation:
    //          1) VFS currentImplVersion is stored in a single dedicated place, in 'version.txt' file (human-readable)
    //          2) Each VFS storage manages its own on-disk-format-version -- i.e. each storage has its own CURRENT_IMPL_VERSION,
    //             which it stores somewhere in a file(s) header. And each storage is responsible for detecting on-disk version,
    //             and either read the known format, or read-and-silently-upgrade the known but slightly outdated format, or throw
    //             an error if it can't deal with on-disk data at all.
    //          VFS.currentImplVersion is changed only on a major format changes, there implement 'upgrade' is too costly, and full
    //          rebuild is the way to go. Another reason for full rebuild is if any of storages is completely confused by on-disk
    //          data (=likely corruption or too old data format). In other cases, VFS could be upgraded 'under the carpet' without
    //          invalidating fileId. Hence, Indexes don't need to be rebuilt.
