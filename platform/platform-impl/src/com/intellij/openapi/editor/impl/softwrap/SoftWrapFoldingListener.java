/**
 * Adapts {@link FoldingListener} to soft wraps specific.
 * <p/>
 * Generally, replaces {@link FoldingListener#onFoldRegionStateChange(FoldRegion)} by {@link #onFoldRegionStateChange(int, int)}.
 * The reason is that soft wraps are assumed to be processed after fold regions, i.e. every time the document is changed, folding
 * is processed at first place (notifying soft wraps via {@link FoldingListener}) and soft wraps are assumed to be processed
 * only on {@link #onFoldProcessingEnd()}. Hence, there is a possible case that changed {@link FoldRegion} object
 * is out-of-date (e.g. its offsets info is dropped if the region is removed), so, we can't use
 * {@link FoldingListener#onFoldRegionStateChange(FoldRegion)}.
