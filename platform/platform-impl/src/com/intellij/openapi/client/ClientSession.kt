/**
 * An object associated with each participant working inside an IDE.
 *
 * There's always the session of the local owner of the IDE, this session lives as long as the [Application] or [Project] itself.
 * In case of Code With Me, there can also be other client sessions corresponding to the joined guests.
 * In case of Gateway, there can also be the client working with the IDE remotely.
 *
 * Manage services registered with `<applicationService client="..."/>` and `<projectService client="..."/>`.
 *
 * One can create per-client services when it's needed to
 * 1) alter the behavior between the local, controller, and guests
 * 2) to have the data kept on a per-client basis
 *
 * Getting a service with [Application.getService] or [Project.getService] searches through per-client services of the current [ClientId],
 * there's also [Application.getServices] or [Project.getServices] for getting all services, that should be enough for simple cases.
 * If you need more control over client sessions or per-client services, take a look at the API of [ClientSessionsManager].
 *
 * Avoid exposing [ClientSession] and its inheritors in the public API.
 * Use sessions and per-client services internally in your code instead of relaying on [ClientId] implicitly stored in the context of execution.
