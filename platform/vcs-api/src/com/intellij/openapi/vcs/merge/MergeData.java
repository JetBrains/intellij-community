 * MergeData contains information about revisions
 *
 * ORIGINAL - is the content which the file had before conflicting change  ("Base" - middle panel)
 * LAST     - is the content which came from the server while updating     ("Theirs" - right panel)
 * CURRENT  - is the content from local changes                            ("Ours" - left panel)
 *
 * byte[] - raw file content
 * {@link MergeProvider} should initialize all three contents, because null value is treated as an error, not as blank content.
