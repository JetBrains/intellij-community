/**
 * <h3>Example 1</h3>
 * <p>
 * {@linkplain com.intellij.psi.SmartPsiElementPointer Smart pointers} might be used to restore the element across different read actions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Elements are expected to stay valid within a single {@linkplain Application#runReadAction read action}.
 * It's highly advised to split long read actions into several short ones, but this also means
 * that some {@linkplain Application#runWriteAction write action} might be run in between these short read actions,
 * which could potentially change the model of the element (reference model, PSI model, framework model or whatever model).
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * val pointer = readAction {
 *   val instance = obtainSomeInstanceWhichIsValidWithinAReadAction()
 *   return@readAction instance.createPointer()
 * }
 * // the pointer might be safely stored in the UI or another model for later usage
 * readAction { // another read action
 *   val restoredInstance = pointer.dereference()
 *   if (restoredInstance == null) {
 *     // instance was invalidated, act accordingly
 *     return
 *   }
 *   // at this point the instance is valid because it should've not exist if it's not
 *   doSomething(restoredInstance)
 * }
 *
 * readAction {
 *   // same pointer may be used in several subsequent read actions
 *   val restoredInstance = pointer.dereference()
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Example 2</h3>
 * <p>
 * Pointers might be used to avoid hard references to the element to save the memory.
 * In this case the pointer stores minimal needed information to be able to restore the element when requested.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Equality</h3>
 * <p>
 * It's expected that most pointers would require a read action for comparison, thus no equality is defined for pointers.
 * Pointers should be {@linkplain Pointer#dereference de-referenced} in a read action, and their values should be compared instead.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> type of underlying element
