 * Methods and constructors annotated with {@code RequiresWriteLock} must be called only with write lock held.
 * Parameters annotated with {@code RequiresWriteLock} must be callables and are guaranteed to be called with write lock held.
 *
 * <p/>Aside from a documentation purpose, the annotation is processed by the {@link org.jetbrains.jps.devkit.threadingModelHelper}.
 * The plugin instruments annotated elements with {@link Application#assertWriteAccessAllowed()} calls
 * to ensure annotation's contract is not violated at runtime. The instrumentation can be disabled
 * by setting {@link RequiresWriteLock#generateAssertion()} to {@code false}.

 * <p/> <b>Important:</b> the instrumentation has limitations. Please read the docs
