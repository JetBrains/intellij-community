/**
 * An executor that allows cancelling given runnables on disposal of [Disposable]s associated using [expireWith]. This also ensures that
 * if the task is a coroutine suspended at some execution point, it's resumed with a [CancellationException] giving the coroutine a chance
 * to clean up any resources it might have acquired before suspending. The executor is created by calling {@link #on}, the expirations are
 * specified by chained calls. For example, to invoke some action that cancels when project is disposed, one can use
 * {@code ExpirableExecutor.on(AppExecutorUtil.getAppExecutorService()).expireWith(project).
 * @deprecated use coroutines and their cancellation mechanism instead
