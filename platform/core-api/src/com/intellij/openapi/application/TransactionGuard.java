/**
 * A service managing model transactions.<p/>
 *
 * A transaction ensures that IntelliJ model (PSI, documents, VFS, project roots etc.) isn't modified in an unexpected way
 * while working with it, with either read or write access. The main property of transactions is mutual exclusion: at most one transaction
 * can be running at any given time. The code inside transaction can perform read or write actions and, more importantly, show dialogs
 * and process UI events in other ways: it's guaranteed that no one will be able to sneak in with an unexpected model change using
 * {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)} or analogs.<p/>
 *
 * Transactions are run on UI thread and have read access. Write actions that modify model are only allowed inside write-safe contexts. These are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Transactions</li>
 *   <li>Direct user activity processing (key/mouse presses, actions)</li>
 *   <li>{@link Application#invokeLater(Runnable, ModalityState)} calls with a modality state that's either non-modal
 *   or was started inside a write-safe context (for example, a dialog shown from an action wrapped into a transaction)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * All other contexts are considered write-unsafe, and model modifications are not allowed from them.
 * Even if user activity happens in such context
 * (e.g. someone clicks a button in a dialog shown from {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)}),
 * this will result in an assertion.
 * Synchronous transactions ({@link #submitTransactionAndWait(Runnable)} are also not allowed from such invokeLater calls.
 *
 * The recommended way to perform a transaction is to invoke {@link #submitTransaction(Disposable, Runnable)}. It either runs the transaction immediately
 * (if in write-safe context on UI thread) or queues it to invoke at some later moment, when it becomes possible.<p/>
 *
 * Sometimes transactions need to be processed as soon as possible, even if another transaction is already running. Example:
 * outer transaction has shown a dialog with a modal progress that performs a write action inside (which requires a transaction)
 * and waits for it to be finished. For such cases, a context transaction id
 * should be supplied to the nested transaction via {@link #submitTransaction(Disposable, TransactionId, Runnable)}.
 *
 * <p><h1>FAQ</h1></p>
 *
 * Q: When should transactions be used?
 * A: Whenever the code inside isn't prepared to model being modified from the outside world. Which is, almost always. Well known base AnAction
 * classes that work with PSI are wrapped into transactions by default. It only makes sense to opt out (by overriding AnAction#startInTransaction), if your actions
 * don't modify the PSI/document/VFS model in any way, and can be invoked in a dialog that's shown from invokeLater.
 * <p/>
 *
 * Q: I've got <b>"Write access is allowed from model transactions only"</b>
 *    or <b>"Cannot run synchronous submitTransactionAndWait"</b> exception, what do I do?<br/>
 * A: You're likely inside an "invokeLater" or "invokeAndWait"-like call.
 * <ul>
 * <li/> If this code is showing a dialog that requires model consistency during its lifetime,
 * consider replacing invokeLater with {@link #submitTransaction(Disposable, Runnable)} or
 * {@link #submitTransaction(Disposable, TransactionId, Runnable)}.<br/>
 * <li/> Consider simplifying the code. For example, if the outer code is known to be run on EDT, "invokeLater(AndWait)IfNeeded" call can be removed. If it's in a pooled thread, the "IfNeeded" part can be removed. "invokeAndWaitIfNeeded" can be safely unwrapped, if already on EDT.
 * <li/> Consider making the code synchronous. "invokeLater" from EDT rarely makes sense and can often be replaced with synchronous execution (which will likely be inside a user activity: a write-safe context).
 * <li/> If you get the assertion from synchronous document commit or VFS refresh, consider making them asynchronous. For documents, use {@link com.intellij.psi.PsiDocumentManager#performLaterWhenAllCommitted(Runnable)}.
 * You can also try to get rid of them at all, by making your code work only with VFS and PSI and assuming
 * they're refreshed/committed often enough by some other code.
 * <li/> If you still have "invokeAndWaitIfNeeded" call with model-changing activity inside, replace it with {@link #submitTransactionAndWait(Runnable)} or {@link Application#invokeAndWait}.
 * You might still get assertions after that, that would mean that some caller down the stack is also using "invokeLater"-like call and needs to be fixed as well.
 * <li/> If you still absolutely need "invokeLater" use {@link Application#invokeLater} (or GuiUtils for "invokeLaterIfNeeded"),
 * and pass a modality state that appeared in a write-safe context (e.g. a background progress started in an action).
 * Most likely {@link ModalityState#defaultModalityState()} will do.
 * Don't forget to check inside the "later" runnable that it's still actual, that the model haven't been changed by someone else since its scheduling.
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 *
 * Q: What's the difference between transactions and read/write actions and commands ({@link com.intellij.openapi.command.CommandProcessor})?<br/>
 * A: Read actions in background threads ensure that no one will modify the model while you're working with it.<br/>
 * Write actions (in Swing thread only) allow to modify the model, but ensure that no background thread is reading it in the meantime.<br/>
 * Read action in Swing thread is special: it allows to perform a write action inside. This can lead to troubles
 * if some foreign invokeLater call modifies the model while you're showing a modal progress that's not supposed to change anything.
 * Transactions (in Swing thread only) allow for interactive model processing with read and write actions inside,
 * with modal dialogs and progresses, with a guarantee that only you may modify the model, and not random invokeLater's.<br/>
 * Commands are used for tracking document changes for undo/redo functionality, so they're orthogonal to transactions.
