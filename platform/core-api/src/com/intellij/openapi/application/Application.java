/**
 * Provides access to core application-wide functionality and methods for working with the IDE's thread model.
 * <p>
 * The thread model defines three types of locks which provide access the PSI and other IDE data structures:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Read lock</b> provides read access to the data. Can be obtained from any thread concurrently with other Read locks
 *   and Write Intent lock.</li>
 *   <li><b>Write Intent lock</b> provides read access to the data and the ability to acquire Write lock. Can be obtained from
 *   any thread concurrently with Read locks, but cannot be acquired if another Write Intent lock is held on another thread.</li>
 *   <li><b>Write lock</b> provides read and write access to the data. Can only be obtained from under Write Intent lock.
 *   Cannot be acquired if a Read lock is held on another thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The compatibility matrix for these locks is reflected below.
 * <table>
 *   <tr><th style="width: 20px;"></th><th style="width: 15px;">R</th><th style="width: 15px;">IW</th><th style="width: 15px;">W</th></tr>
 *   <tr><th>R</th><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>-</td></tr>
 *   <tr><th>IW</th><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
 *   <tr><th>W</th><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * Obtaining locks manually is not recommended. The recommended way to obtain read and write locks is to run so-called
 * "read actions" and "write actions" via {@link #runReadAction} and {@link #runWriteAction}, respectively.
 * <p>
 * The recommended way to obtain Write Intent lock is to schedule execution on so-called "write thread" (i.e. thread with Write Intent lock)
 * via {@link #invokeLaterOnWriteThread}, {@link WriteThread} or {@link AppUIExecutor#onWriteThread} asynchronous API.
 * <p>
 * Multiple read actions can run at the same time without locking each other.
 * <p>
 * If there are read actions running at this moment {@code runWriteAction} is blocked until they are completed.
 * <p>
 * See also <a href="https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/architectural_overview/general_threading_rules.html">General Threading Rules</a>.
