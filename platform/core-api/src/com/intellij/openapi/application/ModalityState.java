/**
 * Represents the stack of active modal dialogs. Used in calls to {@link Application#invokeAndWait(Runnable, ModalityState)} to specify
 * that the corresponding runnable is to be executed within the given modality state, i.e. when the same set modal dialogs is present, or its subset.<p/>
 *
 * Modality state is used to prevent the following scenario. Someone does SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait, but there are already other runnables in
 * Swing queue, so they are executed before and show a dialog (e.g. asking a yes/no question). While this dialog is shown, further events are pumped
 * from the queue, including the one scheduled before, which does something very dramatic, e.g. removes a module from the project, deletes some files,
 * invalidates PSI. It's executed, and only then the user closes the dialog. The code that invoked that dialog now has to deal with the completely
 * changed world, where PSI that it worked with might be already invalid, dumb mode (see {@link com.intellij.openapi.project.DumbService})
 * might have unexpectedly begun, etc. But normally clients of yes/no question dialogs aren't prepared to this at all, so exceptions are likely to arise.
 * Worse than that, there'll be no indication on why a particular change has occurred, because the runnable that was incorrectly invoked-later will
 * in many cases leave no trace of itself.<p/>
 *
 * For these reasons, it's strongly advised to use {@link Application#invokeAndWait(Runnable, ModalityState)} everywhere.
 * {@link javax.swing.SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)} and {@link com.intellij.util.ui.UIUtil} convenience methods can be used in the
 * pure UI code, but not with anything that deals with PSI or VFS.
