/**
 * Represents the stack of active modal dialogs. Used in calls to {@link Application#invokeLater} to specify
 * that the corresponding runnable is to be executed within the given modality state, i.e., when the same set modal dialogs is present, or its subset.<p/>
 *
 * The primary purpose of the modality state is to guarantee code model (PSI/VFS/etc) correctness during user interaction.
 * Consider the following scenario:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Some code invokes {@code SwingUtilities#invokeLater}</li>
 *   <li>Before that, the user action is processed which shows a dialog (e.g., asking a yes/no question)</li>
 *   <li>While this dialog is shown, the event scheduled before is processed and does something very dramatic, e.g., removes a module from the project, deletes some files,
 *   invalidates PSI</li>
 *   <li>The user closes the dialog</li>
 *   <li>The code that invoked that dialog now has to deal with the completely
 *   changed world, where PSI that it worked with might be already invalid, dumb mode (see {@link DumbService})
 *   might have unexpectedly begun, etc.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Normally clients of yes/no question dialogs aren't prepared for this at all, so exceptions are likely to arise.
 * Worse than that, there'll be no indication on why a particular change has occurred, because the runnable that was incorrectly invoked-later will
 * in many cases leave no trace of itself.<p/>
 *
 * For these reasons, it's strongly advised to use {@link Application#invokeLater} methods everywhere instead of
 * {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)} and {@link com.intellij.util.ui.UIUtil} convenience methods.<p/>
 *
 * {@link SwingUtilities#invokeLater(Runnable)}, {@link #any()} and {@link com.intellij.util.ui.UIUtil} convenience methods may be used in the
 * purely UI-related code, but not with anything that deals with PSI or VFS.
