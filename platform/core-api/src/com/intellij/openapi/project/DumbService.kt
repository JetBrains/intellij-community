 * A service managing the IDE's 'dumb' mode: when indexes are updated in the background, and the functionality is very much limited.

 *
 *
 * "Dumb" mode starts and ends in a [com.intellij.openapi.application.WriteAction], so if you're inside a [ReadAction]
 * on a background thread, it won't suddenly begin in the middle of your operation. But note that whenever you start
 * a top-level read action on a background thread, you should be prepared to anything being changed, including "dumb"
 * mode being suddenly on and off. To avoid executing a read action in "dumb" mode, please use [runReadActionInSmartMode] or
 * [com.intellij.openapi.application.NonBlockingReadAction.inSmartMode].
