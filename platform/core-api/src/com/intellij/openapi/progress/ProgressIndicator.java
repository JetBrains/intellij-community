/**
 * <p>An object accompanying a computation, usually in a background thread. It allows displaying process status to the user
 * ({@link #setText}, {@link #setText2}, {@link #setFraction}, {@link #setIndeterminate}) and
 * interrupt if the computation is canceled ({@link #checkCanceled()}).</p>
 *
 * <p>There are many implementations which may implement only parts of the functionality in this interface. Some indicators are invisible,
 * not showing any status to the user, but still tracking cancellation.</p>
 *
 * <p>To run a task with a visible progress indicator, modal or displayed in the status bar, please use {@link ProgressManager#run} methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>To associate a thread with a progress, use {@link ProgressManager#runProcess} methods. This is mostly
 * used with invisible progress indicators for cancellation handling. A common case is to take a read action that's interrupted by a write action
 * about to occur in the UI thread, to avoid UI freezes (see {@link com.intellij.openapi.application.ReadAction#nonBlocking(Runnable)}).
 * Another common case is wrapping main thread's to parallelize the associated computation by forking additional threads.</p>
 *
 * <p>Current thread's progress indicator, visible or not, can be retrieved with {@link ProgressManager#getGlobalProgressIndicator()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here are some commonly used implementations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link EmptyProgressIndicator}: invisible (ignores text/fraction-related methods), used only for cancellation tracking.
 *   Remembers its creation modality state.</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.ProgressIndicatorBase}: invisible, but can be made visible by subclassing:
 *   remembers text/fraction inside and allows to retrieve them and possibly show in the UI. Non-modal by default.</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.ProgressWindow}: visible progress, either modal or background. Usually not created directly,
 *   instantiated internally inside {@link ProgressManager#run}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.ProgressWrapper}: wraps an existing progress indicator, usually to fork another thread
 *   with the same cancellation policy. Use {@link com.intellij.concurrency.SensitiveProgressWrapper} to allow
 *   that separate thread's indicator to be canceled independently from the main thread.</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>Calling ProgressIndicator methods must conform to these simple lifecycle rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #start()} can be called only once after the indicator was created. (Or also after {@link #stop()}, if the indicator is reusable -
 *   see {@link com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.AbstractProgressIndicatorBase#isReuseable()})</li>
 *   <li>{@link #stop()} can be called only once after {@link #start()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #setModalityProgress(ProgressIndicator)} can be called only before {@link #start()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #setFraction(double)}/{@link #getFraction()} can be called only after {@code setIndeterminate(false)}</li>
 * </ul></p>
