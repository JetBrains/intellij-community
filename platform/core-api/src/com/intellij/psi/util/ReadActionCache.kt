/**
 * An application service, which provides a [processingContext] bound to the current read-action.
 * It allows storing some data, which is actual for the current read-action only.
 * The [processingContext] is shared only in the current thread, thus no thread-contention is expected,
 * and no synchronisation is needed.
 * After the current read-action ends, the [processingContext] is removed and all the data inside it becomes
 * eligible for garbage collection. It makes a good way for a [short-living caching][ReadActionCachedValue].
 *
 * The [processingContext] is available only inside read-actions, which guarantee that "world" will not change
 * between accessing the same [processingContext].
 * It also available in write-action when called inside the [allowInWriteAction] blocks.
