# Implicit support for PersistenceStateComponent

The new Settings Controller API is currently not intended for use by end clients. All existing implementations of `PersistenceStateComponent` that don't use the deprecated API like `JDOMExternalizable` are fully supported, and no changes are required. Support here means that each component property serves as a key, not the whole component.

How is it possible, and how is it implemented? To understand the explanation, there are several key things you need to know:

* Historically, the IntelliJ Platform uses its own serialization framework.
* The `PersistenceStateComponent` has always been recommended to be implemented using state classes, rather than directly using XML DOM.

Thus, if you have XML data and a state class, you can employ the XML serialization framework to interact with the object at a property level.

You can find example in [StateStorageBackedByController](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/settings-local/src/com/intellij/platform/settings/local/StateStorageBackedByController.kt).

In a nutshell:

* State class it is a [BeanBinding](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/util/src/com/intellij/util/xmlb/BeanBinding.java).
* Each bean binding consists of a list of [NestedBinding](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/util/src/com/intellij/util/xmlb/NestedBinding.java). It is a property.
  * `BeanBinding.serializePropertyInto` to serialize. 
  * `BeanBinding.deserializeInto` to deserialize. 

Please note that this API is internal and low-level. It requires a profound understanding of the IntelliJ Platform. It may not be as straightforward as it sounds. 
Therefore, its use outside of the IJ Platform is strongly discouraged.

## Format

For primitive values (no binding or binding plus converter, meaning effectively is a string): `"a string"`, `number`, `boolean`.
In other words, a string is quoted with double quotes and other primitive values as is (JSON syntax).

For complex values (binding exists), like 
* map (`MapBinding`), 
* collection (`AbstractCollectionBinding` â€” `ArrayBinding` or `CollectionBinding`),
* bean (`BeanBinding` and `KotlinAwareBeanBinding`, about `KotlinxSerializationBinding` see note about custom bindings), 

also a JSON syntax is used. 

### Maps

```json
{
  "mapKey": "primitiveValue"
}
```

If a map has a complex key, then it is an array of objects, with each object representing a single key-value pair: 

```json
[
  {
    "key": {},
    "value": "someValue"
  },
  {
    "key2": {}, 
    "value": "someValue"
  }
]
```

Maps with non-primitive keys are expected to be rare.
Currently, `SettingDescriptor` lacks tags for distinguishing formats or providing format details. 
These could be added if necessary.

### Collections

```json
[
  "primitive",
  true,
  {
    "complexFieldOfComplexArrayItem": "",
    "complexFieldOfComplexArrayItem2": "" 
  }
]
```

For polymorphic collections, a special key `_class` is used as a class discriminator.

```json
{
  "v": [
    {
      "_class": "BeanWithPublicFields",
      "int_v": 1,
      "string_v": "hello"
    },
    {
      "_class": "BeanWithPublicFieldsDescendant",
      "new_s": "foo",
      "int_v": 1,
      "string_v": "hello"
    },
    {
      "_class": "BeanWithPublicFields",
      "int_v": 1,
      "string_v": "hello"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Binding

A value for a custom binding is a black box.

* `KotlinxSerializationBinding` is currently serialized as JSON using a kotlinx serialization framework. This binding is experimental and has never been recommended for non-cache data. Therefore, the discussion about what to do with it will be set aside for now. 
* `JDOMElementBinding` is serialized as XML as is. It is deprecated and is expected to be rare.
