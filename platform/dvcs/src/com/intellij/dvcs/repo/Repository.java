/**
 * <p>
 * Repository is a representation of a Git repository stored under the specified directory.
 * It stores the information about the repository, which is frequently requested by other plugin components.
 * All get-methods (like {@link #getCurrentRevision()}) are just getters of the correspondent fields and thus are very fast.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Repository is updated "externally" by the appropriate Updater class}, when correspondent {@code .git/ or .hg/} service files
 * change.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To force asynchronous update, it is enough to call {@link VirtualFile#refresh(boolean, boolean) refresh} on the root directory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To make a synchronous update of the repository call {@link #update()}.
 * Updating requires reading from disk, so it may take some time, however, updating the whole community repository took ~10 ms at the time
 * of measurement, so must be fast enough. Better not to be called in AWT though.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Getters and setters (update...()-methods) are not synchronized intentionally - to avoid live- and deadlocks.
 * GitRepository is updated asynchronously,
 * so even if the getters would have been synchronized, it wouldn't guarantee that they return actual values (as they are in .git).
 * <br/>
 * If one needs a really 100 % up-to-date value, one should call {@link #update()} and then get...().
 * update() is a synchronous read from repository file (.git or .hg), so it is guaranteed to query the real value.
 * </p>
