 * Considering the existing needs, the currently provided API should be enough.
 * 2. Tiding execution to the debugger's [CoroutineScope]s. The provided API ensures job cancellation by attaching to
 * [DebuggerManagerThreadImpl.coroutineScope] or [SuspendContextImpl.getCoroutineScope].
 * With a publicly available dispatcher, this should be ensured by the API users.
 * 3. Switching between different command types. The provided API ensures correct switching between the debugger commands.
 * With a publicly available dispatcher, the current solution should be reconsidered.
