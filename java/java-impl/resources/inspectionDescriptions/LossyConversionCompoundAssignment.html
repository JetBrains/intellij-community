Reports compound assignments if the type of the right-hand operand is not assignment compatible with the type of the variable.
<p>
During such compound assignments, an implicit cast occurs, potentially resulting in lossy conversions.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  long c = 1;
  c += 1.2;
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  long c = 1;
  c += (long) 1.2;
</code></pre>
