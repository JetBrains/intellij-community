Reports large array allocations which do not check
for <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</code>. In memory
constrained environments, allocations of large data objects should probably
be checked for memory depletion.
<p>
  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
