Reports exceptions that are declared in a method's signature but never thrown by the method itself or its implementations and overriding methods.
<p>The inspection ignores methods related to serialization, for example the methods <code>readObject()</code> and <code>writeObject()</code>.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void method() throws InterruptedException {
    System.out.println();
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix removes unnecessary exceptions from the declaration and normalizes redundant <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>
  void method() {
    System.out.println();
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> Some exceptions may not be reported during in-editor highlighting for performance reasons.
  To see all results, run the inspection by selecting  <b>Code | Inspect Code</b> or <b>Code | Analyze Code | Run Inspection by Name</b> from the main menu.
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Use the <b>Ignore exceptions thrown by entry point methods</b> option to not report exceptions thrown by
  for example <code>main()</code> methods.
  Entry point methods can be configured in the settings of the
  <a href="settings://Errors?Unused%20Declaration%20entry%20point">Java | Declaration redundancy | Unused declaration</a> inspection.
