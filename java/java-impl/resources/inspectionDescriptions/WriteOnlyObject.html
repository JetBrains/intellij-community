Reports objects that are modified but never queried.
<p>The inspection relies on the method mutation contract, which could be inferred
  or pre-annotated for some library methods. This inspection does not report collections, maps, and string builders, as these types
  are reported by other more precise inspections.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  AtomicReference&lt;String&gt; ref = new AtomicReference&lt;&gt;();
  ref.set("hello"); // ref is never used again
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the <b>Ignore impure constructors</b> option to control whether to process objects created by constructor or method whose purity is not known.
  Unchecking the option may introduce some false-positives if the object reference is intentionally leaked during the construction.
