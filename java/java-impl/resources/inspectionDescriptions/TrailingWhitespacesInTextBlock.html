Reports text blocks with trailing whitespace characters.
Trailing whitespace is considered incidental and will be stripped away by the Java compiler.
<p><b>Example (where spaces are indicated with dots):</b></p>
<pre><code>
..String.count.=."""
....one
....two....
....three
....""";
</code></pre>
<p>Two quick-fixes are provided.
  One to remove the trailing whitespace, and one to escape the trailing whitespace so that it will not be removed by the compiler:</p>
<pre><code>
..String.count.=."""
....one
....two...\s
....three
....""";
</code></pre>
