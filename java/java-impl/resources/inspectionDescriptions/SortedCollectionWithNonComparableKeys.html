Reports construction of sorted collections, for example <code>TreeSet</code>, that rely on natural ordering,
whose element type doesn't implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface.
<p>It's unlikely that such a collection will work properly.</p>
<p>
  A false positive is possible if the collection element type is a non-comparable super-type,
  but the collection is intended to only hold comparable sub-types. Even if this is the case,
  it's better to narrow the collection element type or declare the super-type as <code>Comparable</code> because the mentioned approach is error-prone.

<p>
  The inspection also reports cases when the collection element is a type parameter which is not declared as <code>extends Comparable</code>.
  You can suppress the warnings on type parameters using the provided option (for example, to keep the API compatibility).
