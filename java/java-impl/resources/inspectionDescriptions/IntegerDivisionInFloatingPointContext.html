Reports integer divisions where the result is used as a floating-point number.
Such division is often an error and may have unexpected results
due to the truncation that happens in integer division.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  float x = 3.0F + 3 * 2 / 5;
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  float x = 3.0F + ((float) (3 * 2)) /5;
</code></pre>
