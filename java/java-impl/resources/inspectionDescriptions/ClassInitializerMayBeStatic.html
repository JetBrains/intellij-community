Reports instance initializers which can be made <code>static</code> without producing any errors.
<p>
  An instance initializer may be static if it does not reference any of its class' non-static members.
  Static initializers are executed once when the class is resolved,
  while instance initializers are executed on each instantiation of the class.</p>
<p>This inspection doesn't report instance empty initializers and initializers in anonymous classes.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class A {
     public static String CONSTANT;
     {
        CONSTANT = "Hello";
     }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  class A {
     public static String CONSTANT;
     static {
        CONSTANT = "Hello"; //now initialized only once per class
     }
  }
</code></pre>
