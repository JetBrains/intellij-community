Reports comparisons where left and right operand represent the identical expression.
While sometimes comparing an expression with itself could be intended, in most cases, it is an oversight.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  // Probably left.getLength() == right.getLength() was intended
  boolean result = left.getLength() == left.getLength();
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  To ignore comparisons that may produce side effects, use the <b>Ignore conditions with side effects</b> option.
Disabling this option may lead to false-positives, for example, when the same method returns different values on subsequent invocations.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  native int unknownMethod();
  
  ...
  
  if (unknownMethod() &gt; unknownMethod()) {
    System.out.println("Got it");
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Due to possible side effects of <code>unknownMethod()</code> (on the example), the warning will only be
  triggered if the <b>Ignore conditions with side effects</b> option is disabled.</p>
