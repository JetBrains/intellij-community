Reports any <code>import</code> statements that cover entire packages ('* imports').
<p>Some coding standards prohibit such <code>import</code> statements.</p>
<p>
  You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to detect and fix such statements with its <b>Optimize Imports</b>
  command. Go to <a href="settings://preferences.sourceCode.Java?Use%20single%20class%20import">Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Imports</a>,
  make sure that the <b>Use single class import</b> option is enabled, and specify values in the
  <b>Class count to use import with '*'</b> and <b>Names count to use static import with '*'</b> fields.
  Thus this inspection is mostly useful for offline reporting on code bases that you don't
  intend to change.
