Reports negative int hexadecimal constants in long context. Such constants are implicitly widened to
long, which means their higher bits will become 1 rather than 0 (e.g., 0xFFFF_FFFF will become 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFFL).
Unlikely this is intended, and even if it is, using an explicit long constant would be less confusing.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  // Warning: this is int constant -1 which is widened to long
  // becoming 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFFL.
  long mask = 0xFFFF_FFFF;
</code></pre>
