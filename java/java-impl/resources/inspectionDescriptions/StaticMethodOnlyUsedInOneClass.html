Reports <code>static</code> methods and fields that
are only used from a class other than the containing class. Such members could be moved into the using class.
Factory methods and members accessed from an anonymous class inside the member's class are ignored by this inspection.
Convenience overloads, which call a method with the same name in the same class but have fewer parameters, are also ignored.

<p>
Use the first checkbox to suppress this inspection when the static member is only used from a test class.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore member usages from inside anonymous, local, or non-static inner classes.
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to not warn on members that cannot be moved without problems,
  for example, because a method with an identical signature is already present in the target class,
  or because a field or a method used inside the method will not be accessible when this method is moved.
<p>
Use the fourth checkbox to ignore members located in utility classes.
