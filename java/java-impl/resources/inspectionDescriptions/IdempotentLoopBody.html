Reports loops whose second and all subsequent iterations do not produce any additional side effects other
than the one produced by the first iteration, which can indicate a programming error.
<p>Such loops may iterate only zero, one, or infinite number of times.
If the infinite number of times case is unreachable, such a loop can be replaced with an <code>if</code> statement.
  Otherwise, there's a possibility that the program can get stuck.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
    public void foo(String baseName, String names) {
        int suffix = 1;
        String name = baseName;
        while (names.contains(name)) {
            // error: suffix is not updated making loop body idempotent
            name = baseName + suffix;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
