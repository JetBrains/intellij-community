Reports usages of deprecated APIs (classes, fields, and methods) that are marked for removal with
  <code>@Deprecated(<b>forRemoval</b>=true)</code>.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  The code that uses an API marked for removal may cause a runtime error with a future version of the API. That is why
  the recommended severity for this inspection is <i>Error</i>.</p>
<p>
  You can change the severity to <i>Warning</i> if you want to use the same code highlighting as in ordinary deprecation.</p>
