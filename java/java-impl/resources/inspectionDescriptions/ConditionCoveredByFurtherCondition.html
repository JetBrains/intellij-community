Reports conditions that become redundant as they are completely covered by a subsequent condition.
<p>For example, in the <code>value != -1 && value > 0</code> condition, the first part is redundant:
if it's false, then the second part is also false.
Or in a condition like <code>obj != null && obj instanceof String</code>,
  the null-check is redundant as <code>instanceof</code> operator implies non-nullity.</p>
