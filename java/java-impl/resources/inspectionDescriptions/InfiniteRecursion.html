Reports methods that call themselves infinitely unless an exception is thrown.
<p>
  Methods reported by this inspection cannot return normally.
  While such behavior may be intended, in many cases this is just an oversight.

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>  int baz() {
      return baz();
  }</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
