Reports any usages of variables which are known to be constant.
<p>This is the case if the (read) use of the variable is surrounded by an
<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>for</code>
statement with an <code>==</code> condition which compares the variable with a constant.
  In this case, the use of a variable which is known to be constant can be replaced with
  an actual constant.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
    private static void foo(double number) {
        if (number == 1.0) {
            f(number);
        }
    }
    private static void f(double number) {}
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
    private static void foo(double number) {
        if (number == 1.0) {
            f(1.0);
        }
    }
    private static void f(double number) {}
</code></pre>
