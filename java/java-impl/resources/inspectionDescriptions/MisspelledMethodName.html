Reports cases in which multiple methods of a class have the names that differ only by
case. Such names may be very confusing.
<p><b>Example:</b>
<pre><code>
  public int hashcode() { // reported, should be hashCode probably?
    return 0;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such methods is available only in the editor.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Use the <b>Ignore methods overriding/implementing a super method</b> option to ignore methods overriding or implementing a method from
  the superclass.
