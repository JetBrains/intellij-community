Reports <code>abstract</code> methods that override <code>abstract</code> methods.
<p>Such methods don't make sense because any concrete child class will have to implement the abstract method anyway.</p>
<p>
  Methods whose return types, exception declarations, annotations, or modifiers differ from the overridden method are not reported by this inspection.
