Reports parts of method specification written in English that contradict with the method declaration. This includes:
<ul>
  <li>Method specified to return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> but its return type is not boolean.</li>
  <li>Method specified to return <code>null</code> but it's annotated as <code>@NotNull</code> or its return type is primitive.</li>
  <li>Method specified to return list but its return type is set or array.</li>
  <li>And so on.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  /**
   * @return true if user is found, false otherwise
   */
  User findUser(String name);
</code></pre>
<p>
  Note that false-positives are possible, as this inspection tries to interpret a human language. However, if the inspection reports
  incorrectly, it's still possible that the description is confusing and should be rewritten.
