Reports JDBC resources that are not safely closed. JDBC resources reported
by this inspection include <code>java.sql.Connection</code>,
<code>java.sql.Statement</code>, <code>java.sql.PreparedStatement</code>,
<code>java.sql.CallableStatement</code>, and <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code>.
<p>
  By default, the inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with
  'close' or 'cleanup' in its name.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  ResultSet findAllElements(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM TABLE");//statement is not closed
    statement.execute();
    return statement.getResultSet();
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the following options to configure the inspection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whether a JDBC resource is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code>
    block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource
    in front of a <code>try</code> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
  </li>
</ul>
