Reports date format patterns that are likely used by mistake.
<p>The following patterns are reported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uppercase "Y", unless "w" appears nearby. It stands for "Week year" that is almost always
    the same as normal "Year" (lowercase "y" pattern), but may point to the next year
    at the end of December.</li>
  <li>Uppercase "M" (month) close to "H", "K", "h", or "k" (hour). It's likely that a lowercase "m" (minute) was intended.</li>
  <li>Lowercase "m" (minute) close to "y" (year) or "d" (day in month). It's likely that an uppercase "M" (month) was intended.</li>
  <li>Uppercase "D" (day in year) close to "M", or "L" (month). It's likely that a lowercase "d" (day in month) was intended.</li>
  <li>Uppercase "S" (milliseconds) close to "m" (minutes). It's likely that a lowercase "s" (seconds) was intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Examples:<br>
  <code>new SimpleDateFormat("YYYY-MM-dd")</code>: likely <code>"yyyy-MM-dd"</code> was intended.<br>
  <code>new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-DD")</code>: likely <code>"yyyy-MM-dd"</code> was intended.<br>
  <code>new SimpleDateFormat("HH:MM")</code>: likely <code>"HH:mm"</code> was intended.
