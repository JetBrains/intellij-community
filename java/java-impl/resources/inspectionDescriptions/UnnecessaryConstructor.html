Reports unnecessary constructors.
<p>
  A constructor is unnecessary if it is the only constructor of a class, has no parameters,
  has the same access modifier as its containing class,
  and does not perform any initialization except explicitly or implicitly calling the superclass constructor without arguments.
  Such a constructor can be safely removed as it will be generated by the compiler even if not specified.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public class Foo {
    public Foo() {}
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  public class Foo {}
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->

Use the inspection settings to ignore unnecessary constructors that have an annotation.
