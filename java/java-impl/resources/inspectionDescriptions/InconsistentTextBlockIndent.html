Reports text blocks that are indented using both space and tab characters.
This can produce unexpected results because spaces and tabs are treated equally by javac's text block processing.
<p>In the following example, spaces and tabs are visualized as <code>·</code> and <code>␉</code> respectively,
and a tab is equal to 2 spaces in the editor.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
String colors = """
····red
␉ ␉ green
····blue""";
</code></pre>

<p>When printing such a string, the result will be:</p>
<pre><code>
··red
green
··blue
</code></pre>
<p>After the compiler removes an equal number of whitespace characters from the beginning of each line,
some lines remain with leading spaces.</p>
