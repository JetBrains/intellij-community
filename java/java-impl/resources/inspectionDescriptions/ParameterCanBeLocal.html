Reports redundant method parameters that can be replaced with local variables.
<p>If all local usages of a parameter are preceded by assignments to that parameter, the
parameter can be removed and its usages replaced with local variables.
It makes no sense to have such a parameter, as values that are passed to it are overwritten.
  Usually, the problem appears as a result of refactoring.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  void test(int p) {
    p = 1;
    System.out.print(p);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  void test() {
    int p = 1;
    System.out.print(p);
  }
</code></pre>
