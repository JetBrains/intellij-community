Reports expressions that are affected by unboxing conversion (automatic unwrapping of objects into primitive values).
Try not to use objects instead of primitives. It might significantly affect the performance.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>int x = new Integer(42);</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix makes the conversion explicit:</p>
<pre><code>int x = new Integer(42).intValue();</code></pre>

  <i>AutoUnboxing</i> appeared in Java 5.
  This inspection can help to downgrade for backward compatibility with earlier Java versions.
