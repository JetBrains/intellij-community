Reports non-empty packages that are present in several modules.
When packages are contained in several modules, it is very easy to create a class with the same name in two modules.
A module which depends on these modules will see a conflict if it tries to use such a class.
The Java Platform Module System disallows packages contained in more than one module (also called <em>split packages</em>)
