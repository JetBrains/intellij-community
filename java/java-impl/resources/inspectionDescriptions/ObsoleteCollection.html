Reports usages of <code>java.util.Vector</code>, <code>java.util.Hashtable</code> and <code>java.util.Stack</code>.
<p>Usages of these classes can often be replaced with usages of
<code>java.util.ArrayList</code>, <code>java.util.HashMap</code> and <code>java.util.ArrayDeque</code> respectively.
While still supported,
the former classes were made obsolete by the JDK1.2 collection classes, and should probably
not be used in new development.

<p>
Use the <b>Ignore obsolete collection types where they are required</b> option to ignore any cases where the obsolete collections are used
as method arguments or assigned to a variable that requires the obsolete type.
Enabling this option may consume significant processor resources.</p>
