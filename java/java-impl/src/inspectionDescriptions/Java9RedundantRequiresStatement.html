The inspection detects a situation where Java 9 module A requires Java 9 module B, but A doesn't use any package from B.
Also, requiring the module 'java.base' is redundant.
<p>
  The fix deletes the 'requires' directive for such redundant dependencies.
  If the deleted dependency re-exported modules that are actually used, the fix adds 'requires' directive for these modules.
