Reports blank lines in Javadoc comments.
<p>
  Blank lines in Javadoc may signal an intention split the text to different paragraphs. However, the Javadoc tool and IntelliJ IDEA will
  ignore them when rendering documentation comments.
</p>
<p>
  The quick-fix suggests to replace the blank line with a paragraph tag (&lt;p&gt;).
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Main {
    /**
     * Doesn't do anything.
     *
     * Does absolutely nothing
     */
    void foo() {}
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  class Main {
    /**
     * Doesn't do anything.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Does absolutely nothing
     */
    void foo() {}
  }
</code></pre>
