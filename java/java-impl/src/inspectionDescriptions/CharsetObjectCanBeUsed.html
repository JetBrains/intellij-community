Reports methods and constructors where constant charset String literal is used (like <b>"UTF-8"</b>) which could be replaced with
a predefined Charset object like <b>StandardCharsets.UTF_8</b>. This may work a little bit faster, because charset lookup becomes
unnecessary. Also catching <b>UnsupportedEncodingException</b> may become unnecessary as well. In this case the catch block will
be removed automatically.
