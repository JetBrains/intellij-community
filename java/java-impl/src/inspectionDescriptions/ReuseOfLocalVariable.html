Reports local variables that are "reused" overwriting their
values with new values unrelated to their original use.
<p>Such a local variable reuse may be confusing,
as the intended semantics of the local variable may vary with each use. It may also be
prone to bugs if due to the code changes, the values that have been considered overwritten actually
appear to be alive. It is a good practice to keep variable lifetimes as short as possible, and not
  to reuse local variables for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
    void x() {
        String s = "one";
        System.out.println("s = " + s);
        s = "two"; //reuse of local variable 's'
        System.out.println("s = " + s);
    }
</code></pre>
