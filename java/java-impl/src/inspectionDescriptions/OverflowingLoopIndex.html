Reports loops that cannot be completed without an index overflow or loops that don't loop at all.
It usually happens because of a mistake in the update operation.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  void foo(int s) {
    for (int i = s; i > 12; i++) { // i-- should be here
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
