This inspection reports Runnable passed to Cleaner.register() capturing reference that leads to memory leak.
Possible sources of this problem:
<ul>
  <li>Lambda using non static methods, fields or this itself</li>
  <li>Non static inner class (anonymous or not) always captures this reference</li>
  <li>Instance method reference</li>
  <li>Access to outer class non static members from non static inner class</li>
</ul>
<p>This inspection is available since Java 9 only.</p>
