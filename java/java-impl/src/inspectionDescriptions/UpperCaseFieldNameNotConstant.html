Reports non-<code>static</code> non-<code>final</code>
fields whose names are all in upper case.
<p>Such fields may cause confusion by breaking a common naming convention and
  are often used by mistake.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> <pre><code>
  public static int THE_ANSWER = 42; //a warning here: final modifier is missing
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such fields is available only in the editor.</p>
