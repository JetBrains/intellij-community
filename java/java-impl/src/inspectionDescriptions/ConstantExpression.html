Reports compile-time constant expressions and suggests replacing them with their
  actual values. For example, you will be prompted to replace "2 + 2" with "4".

  Use the <b>Don't report when the expression contains references to defined constants</b> option to ignore the expressions which contain references to non-literal operands,
  such as fields, and variables.
