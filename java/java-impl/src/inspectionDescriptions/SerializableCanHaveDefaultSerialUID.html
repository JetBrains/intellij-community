Reports inheritors of Serializable whose <code>serialVersionUID</code> differs from the default generated ones.
This can happen when you use a custom scheme for <code>serialVersionUID</code> or when something in the class changed since the previous
modification of <code>serialVersionUID</code>, which can lead to problems during deserialization.
