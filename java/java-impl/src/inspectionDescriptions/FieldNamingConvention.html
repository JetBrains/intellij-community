Reports fields whose names are too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern.
<p><b>Example:</b> if the inspection is enabled for constants, and the minimum specified length for a field name is 5 (the default), the following constant
  produces a warning because the length of its name is 3, which is less than 5:  <code>public static final int MAX = 42;</code>.</p>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such fields is available only in the editor.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<p>Use the list in the <b>Options</b> section to specify which fields should be checked. Deselect the checkboxes for the fields for which
you want to skip the check.</p>
<p>For each field type, specify the minimum length, maximum length, and the regular expression expected for field names using the
  provided input fields.
  Specify <b>0</b> in the length fields to skip the corresponding checks.</p>
<p>Regular expressions should be specified in the standard
  <code>java.util.regex</code> format.</p>
