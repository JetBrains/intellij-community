Reports socket resources that are not safely closed. Socket resources reported
by this inspection include <code>java.net.Socket</code>,
<code>java.net.DatagramSocket</code>, and <code>java.net.ServerSocket</code>.
<p>
  By default, the inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with
  'close' or 'cleanup' in its name.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  byte[] getMessage(ServerSocket socket) throws IOException {
    Socket client = socket.accept(); //socket is not closed
    return client.getInputStream().readAllBytes();
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the following options to configure the inspection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whether a socket is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code> block.
    This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a <code>try</code> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
  </li>
</ul>
