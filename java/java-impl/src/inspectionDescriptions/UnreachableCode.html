Reports the code which is never reached according to data flow analysis. 
It can be the result of previous always-true or always-false condition, unreachable loop body or 
catch section. Usually (though not always) unreachable code is a consequence of a previous warning,
so check inspection warnings form "Nullability and data flow problems", "Constant values", or
"Redundant operation on empty container" to better understand the cause.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  void finishApplication() {
    System.exit(0);
    System.out.println("Application is terminated"); // Unreachable code
  }
</code></pre>
