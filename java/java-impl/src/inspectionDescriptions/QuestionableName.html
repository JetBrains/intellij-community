Reports variables, methods, or classes with questionable, not really descriptive names.
Such names do not help to understand the code, and most probably were created as a temporary thing but were forgotten afterwards.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  int aa = 42;
</code></pre>
<p>Rename quick-fix is suggested only in the editor.</p>
