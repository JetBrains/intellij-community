Reports when <b>getClass()</b> method is called on <b>java.lang.Class</b> instance. This is usually a mistake as the result is
  always equivalent to <b>Class.class</b>. If it's mistake then the <b>getClass()</b> call should be removed and qualifier should be used
  directly. If the behavior is intended, then it's better to write <b>Class.class</b> explicitly to avoid confusion.
