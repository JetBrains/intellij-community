Reports classes, methods, or fields in the specified inspection scope that are not used or unreachable from entry points.
<p> An entry point can be the main method, tests, classes mentioned outside the specified scope, classes accessible from
  <code>module-info.java</code>, and so on. You can also configure custom entry points by using name patterns or annotations.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public class Department {
    private Organization myOrganization;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>Department</code> explicitly references <code>Organization</code> but if <code>Department</code> class itself is unused, then inspection will report both classes. </p>
<p>
  The inspection also reports parameters that are not used by their methods and all method implementations and overriders, as well as local
  variables that are declared but not used.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> Some unused members may not be reported during in-editor code highlighting. For performance reasons, a non-private member is
  checked only when its name rarely occurs in the project.
  To see all results, run the inspection by selecting <b>Code | Inspect Code</b> or <b>Code | Analyze Code | Run Inspection by Name</b> from the main menu.
</p>

<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Use the visibility settings below to configure members to be reported. For example, configuring report <code>private</code> methods only means
  that <code>public</code> methods of <code>private</code> inner class will be reported but <code>protected</code> methods of top level class
  will be ignored.</p>
<p>
  Use the <b>entry points</b> tab to configure entry points to be considered during the inspection run.</p>
<p> You can add entry points manually when inspection results are ready.</p>
<p> If your code uses unsupported frameworks, there are several options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the framework relies on annotations, use the <b>Annotations...</b> button to configure the framework's annotations.</li>
  <li>If the framework doesn't rely on annotations, try to configure class name patterns that are expected by the framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way the annotated code accessible by the framework internals will be treated as used.</p>
