Reports when <b>equals()</b> is called on specific classes like <b>StringBuilder</b> or <b>StringBuffer</b>.
The <b>equals()</b> method is not overridden in these classes, so may return false even when the contents of two objects are the same.
If reference equality is intended, it's better to use <b>==</b> to avoid confusion.
