Reports when <strong>list.remove(index)</strong> is called inside the ascending counted loop. This is suspicious as list becomes
shorter after that and the element next to removed will not be processed. Simple fix is to decrease the index variable after removal,
but probably removing via iterator or using <strong>removeIf</strong> method (since Java 8) is a more robust alternative.
If you don't expect that <strong>remove</strong> will be called more than once in a loop, consider adding a <strong>break</strong> command
after it.
