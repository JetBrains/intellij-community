Detects loops which second and following iterations do not produce any additional side effects other than produced by the first iteration,
which could indicate a programming error. Such loops may iterate only zero, one or infinite number of times.
If infinite number of times case is unreachable, such loop could be replaced with <b>if</b> statement. Otherwise there's a danger that
the program could stuck. Example:
<pre>
  int suffix = 1;
  String name = baseName;
  while(names.contains(name)) {
    name = baseName + suffix; // error: suffix is not updated making loop body idempotent
  }
</pre>
