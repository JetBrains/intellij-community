Reports non-atomic operations on volatile fields.
<p>
  An example of a non-atomic operation is updating the field using the increment operator.
  As the operation involves read and write, and other modifications may happen in between, data may become corrupted.
  The operation can be made atomic by surrounding it with a <code>synchronized</code> block or
  using one of the classes from the <code>java.util.concurrent.atomic</code> package.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  private volatile int v = 1;

  void foo() {
    v = 2 * v;
  }
</code></pre>
