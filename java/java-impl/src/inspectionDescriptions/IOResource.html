Reports I/O resources that are not safely closed. I/O resources checked
by this inspection include <code>java.io.InputStream</code>,
<code>java.io.OutputStream</code>, <code>java.io.Reader</code>,
<code>java.io.Writer</code>, <code>java.util.zip.ZipFile</code>, <code>java.io.Closeable</code> and <code>java.io.RandomAccessFile</code>.
<p>
  I/O resources wrapped by other I/O resources are not reported, as the wrapped resource will be closed by the wrapping resource.
</p>
<p>
  By default, the inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with
  'close' or 'cleanup' in its name.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void save() throws IOException {
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("filename.txt"); //warning
    writer.write("sample");
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the following options to configure the inspection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>List I/O resource classes that do not need to be closed and should be ignored by this inspection.</li>
  <li>
    Whether an I/O resource is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code>block.
    This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a <code>try</code> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
  </li>
</ul>
