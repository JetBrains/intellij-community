Reports code that always produces the same result, throws an exception, or may violate nullability contracts.
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
<code>if (array.length &lt; index) {
  System.out.println(array[index]);
} // Array index is always out of bounds

if (str == null) System.out.println("str is null");
System.out.println(str.trim());
// the last statement may throw an NPE

@NotNull
Integer square(@Nullable Integer input) {
    // the method contract is violated
    return input == null ? null : input * input;
}</code></pre>
<p>
  The inspection behavior may be controlled by a number of annotations, such as 
  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html">nullability</a> annotations,
  <code><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/contract-annotations.html">@Contract</a></code> annotation, 
  <code>@Range</code> annotation and so on.
</p>

<p>Use the first checkbox to warn when a nullable value is passed as an argument to a method with non-annotated parameter;
stored into non-annotated field or returned from a non-annotated method. In this case, inspection will suggest to propagate
the <code>@Nullable</code> annotation. You can also configure nullability annotations using the 'Configure Annotations' button.
</p>
<p>Use the second checkbox to assume that non-annotated members can be null, so must not be used in non-null context.</p>
<p>Use the third checkbox to report method parameters that cannot be null (e. g. immediately dereferenced in the method body)
  but there are call sites where <code>null</code> literal is passed.</p>
<p>Use the fourth checkbox to report methods that annotated as <code>@Nullable</code> but always return non-null value.
  In this case, it's suggested to change the annotation to <code>@NotNull</code>.</p>
<p>Use the fifth checkbox to avoid reporting assertions that were statically proven to be always true. This also includes 
  conditions like <code>if (alwaysFalseCondition) throw new IllegalArgumentException();</code>.</p>
<p>Use the sixth checkbox to control how the inspection treats <code>assert</code> statements. By default, checkbox is unchecked
which means that the assertions are assumed to be executed (-ea mode). If checkbox is checked, the assertions will be completely ignored
(-da mode).</p>
<p>Use the seventh checkbox to add warnings on reading variables that contain some constant values 
  like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, or <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Use the eighth checkbox to suppress all the warnings where the problem may happen only on some code path. If this checkbox is checked,
  warnings like 'exception is possible' will not be reported, only warnings like 'exception will definitely occur'. This mode
  may greatly reduce a number of false-positives, especially if the code is not consistently annotated with nullability and contract 
  annotations, so it could be useful to find the most important problems in legacy code bases.</p>
