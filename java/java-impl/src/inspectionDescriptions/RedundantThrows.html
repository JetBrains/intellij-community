Reports exceptions that are declared in a method's signature but never thrown by the method itself or its implementations and derivatives.
<p>The inspection ignores methods related to the serialization, for example methods <code>readObject()</code> or <code>writeObject()</code>.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void method() throws InterruptedException {
    System.out.println();
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix removes unnecessary exceptions from the declaration and normalizes the redundant <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>
  void method() {
    System.out.println();
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> Some exceptions might not be reported during in-editor highlighting.
  For performance reasons, a non-private method is checked only when its name rarely occurs in the project.
  To see all results, run the inspection by selecting  <b>Code | Inspect Code</b> or <b>Code | Analyze Code | Run Inspection by Name</b> from the main menu.
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Use the <b>Ignore exceptions thrown by entry points methods</b> option to ignore exceptions thrown by entry points methods.
  Entry points methods are configured the following inspection: <b>Editor | Inspections | Java | Declaration redundancy | Unused declaration</b>.</p>
