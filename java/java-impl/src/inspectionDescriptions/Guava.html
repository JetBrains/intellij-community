Inspection detects usages of Guava's functional primitives like
<b>FluentIterable</b>, <b>Optional</b>, <b>Function</b>, <b>Predicate</b> and <b>Supplier</b>.
<br>
May change semantic: some of lazy-evaluated guava's iterables could be transformed to eager-evaluated iterable.
<br>
This inspection only reports if the project
or module is configured to use a language level
of 8 or higher.
