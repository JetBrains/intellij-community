Reports <code>Channel</code> resources that are not safely closed, including any instances created by calling
<code>getChannel()</code> on a file or socket resource.
<p>
  By default, the inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with
  'close' or 'cleanup' in its name.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void send(Socket socket) throws IOException {
    SocketChannel channel = socket.getChannel(); //warning
    channel.write(ByteBuffer.wrap("message".getBytes()));
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the following options to configure the inspection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whether a <code>Channel</code> resource is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code>
    block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a <code>Channel</code>
    in front of a <code>try</code> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
  </li>
</ul>
