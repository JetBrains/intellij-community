This inspection reports methods where: <br> <br>
&nbsp;- method is empty OR <br>
&nbsp;- all implementations of interface method are empty OR <br>
&nbsp;- method is empty itself and is overridden only by empty methods <br> <br>
Note that a method containing only the <b><font color="#000080">super()</font></b>
call and passing its own parameter is also considered empty.
<br> <br>
This inspection is automatically suppressed for methods annotated with special annotations,
for example, EJB annotations javax.ejb.Init and javax.ejb.Remove.
