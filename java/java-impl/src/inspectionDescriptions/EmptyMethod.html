Reports empty methods that can be removed.
<p>Methods are considered empty if they are empty themselves and if they are overridden or
 implemented by empty methods only. Note that methods containing only comments and the <code>super()</code> call with own parameters are
  also considered empty.</p>
<p>The inspection ignores methods with special annotations, for example, the <code>javax.ejb.Init</code> and <code>javax.ejb.Remove</code> EJB annotations .</p>
<p>The quick-fix safely removes unnecessary methods.</p>
