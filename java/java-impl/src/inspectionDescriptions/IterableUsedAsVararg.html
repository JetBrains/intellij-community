Reports suspicious usages of collection or iterables in vararg method calls. E.g. given method 
  <code>&lt;T&gt; boolean contains(T needle, T... haystack)</code> the call like
  <code>if(contains("item", listOfStrings)) {...}</code> looks suspicious as the list will be 
  wrapped into single element array. Such code can be correctly compiled and likely run without
  exceptions, but it's unlikely intended.
