Reports suspicious usages of <b>Collection</b> or an <b>Iterable</b> in vararg method calls. E.g. given method 
  <pre>&lt;T&gt; boolean contains(T needle, T... haystack) {...}</pre> 
<p>a call like</p>
  <pre>if(contains("item", listOfStrings)) {...}</pre> 
<p>looks suspicious as the list will be wrapped into a single element array. 
  Such code can be successfully compiled and likely run without
  exceptions, but it's unlikely intended.</p>
