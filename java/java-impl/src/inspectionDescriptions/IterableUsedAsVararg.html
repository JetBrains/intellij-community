Reports suspicious usages of <code>Collection</code> or <code>Iterable</code> in vararg method calls.
<p>For example, in the following method:</p>
  <pre>&lt;T&gt; boolean contains(T needle, T... haystack) {...}</pre> 
<p>a call like</p>
  <pre>if(contains("item", listOfStrings)) {...}</pre> 
<p>looks suspicious as the list will be wrapped into a single element array.
  Such code can be successfully compiled and will likely run without
  exceptions, but it's probably used by mistake.</p>
