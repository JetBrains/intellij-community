Reports classes that have the same name as one of their superclasses, while their fully qualified names remain different.
Such class names may be very confusing.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
  <pre><code>
  package util;
  abstract class Iterable&lt;T&gt; implements java.lang.Iterable&lt;T&gt; {}
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such classes is available only in the editor.</p>
