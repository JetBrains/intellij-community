Reports calls to <code>Object.finalize()</code>.
<p>Calling <code>Object.finalize()</code> explicitly may result in objects being placed in an
inconsistent state.
  The garbage collector automatically calls this method on an object when it determines that there are no references to this object.</p>
<p>The inspection doesn't report calls to <code>super.finalize()</code> from within implementations of <code>finalize()</code> as
  they're benign.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  MyObject m = new MyObject();
  m.finalize();
  System.gc()
</code></pre>
