Reports JNDI resources that are not safely closed. JNDI resources reported
by this inspection include <code>javax.naming.InitialContext</code>,
and <code>javax.naming.NamingEnumeration</code>.
<p>
  By default, the inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with
  'close' or 'cleanup' in its name.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  Object findObject(Properties properties, String name) throws NamingException {
    Context context = new InitialContext(properties); //context is not closed
    return context.lookup(name);
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the following options to configure the inspection:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whether a JNDI Resource is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code> block.
    This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a <code>try</code> block.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
  </li>
</ul>
