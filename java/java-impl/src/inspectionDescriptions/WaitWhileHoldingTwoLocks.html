Reports calls to <code>wait()</code> methods that may occur while the current thread is holding two locks.
<p>
  Since calling <code>wait()</code> only releases one lock on its target,
  waiting with two locks held can easily lead to a deadlock.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  synchronized (lockA) {
    synchronized (lockB) {
      lockB.wait(); //warning
      //thread A is stuck here holding lockA
    }
  }

  synchronized (lockA) { //thread B can't enter the block and release thread A
    lockB.notify();
  }
</code></pre>
