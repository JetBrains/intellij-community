Reports inequality conditions that, according to data flow analysis, can be satisfied only for a single operand value.
Such conditions could be replaced with equality conditions to make the code clearer.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  if (x >= 10) {
    ...
    if (x <= 10) { // can be replaced with 'x == 10'
    }
  }
</pre>
