Reports anonymous types which can be replaced with method references.
<p>
  Note that if an anonymous class is converted into an unbound method reference, the same method reference object 
  can be reused by Java runtime during subsequent invocations. On the other hand, when an anonymous class is used, 
  separate objects are created every time. Thus, applying the quick-fix can cause the semantics change in rare cases, 
  e.g. when anonymous class instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.

Method references syntax is not supported under Java 1.7 or earlier JVMs.
