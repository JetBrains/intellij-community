Reports anonymous classes which can be replaced with method references.
<p>
  Note that if an anonymous class is converted into an unbound method reference, the same method reference object 
  can be reused by the Java runtime during subsequent invocations. On the other hand, when an anonymous class is used,
  separate objects are created every time. Thus, applying the quick-fix can cause the semantics change in rare cases, 
  e.g. when anonymous class instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
    Runnable r = new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
        System.out.println();
      }
    };
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix changes this code to the compact form: <code>Runnable r = System.out::println;</code>.</p>
