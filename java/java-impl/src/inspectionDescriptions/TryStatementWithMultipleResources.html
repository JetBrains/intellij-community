Reports <code>try</code> statements with multiple resources that can be automatically split into
  multiple try-with-resources statements.
<p>This conversion can be useful for further refactoring
(for example, for extracting the nested <code>try</code> statement into a separate method). </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("in.txt");
     FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("out.txt")) {
     /*read and write*/
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("in.txt")) {
    try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("out.txt")) {
      /*read and write*/
    }
  }
</code></pre>
