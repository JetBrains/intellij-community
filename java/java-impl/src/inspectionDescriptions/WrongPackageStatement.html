Detects <code>package</code> statements that do not correspond to the project directory structure.
Also, reports classes without <code>package</code> statements if the class is not located directly in
source root directory.
<p>While it's not strictly mandated by Java language, it's good practise to keep classes
from package <code>com.example.myapp</code> inside a <code>com/example/myapp</code> directory directly under
a source root. Failure to do this may confuse code readers and make some tools work incorrectly.</p>
