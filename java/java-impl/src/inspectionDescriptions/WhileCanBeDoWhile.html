  Reports <code>while</code> loops that could be more effectively written as <code>do-while</code> loops.
  There are <code>while</code> loops where the code just before the loop is identical to the code in the body of the loop.
  Replacing with a <code>do-while</code> loop removes the duplicated code.
  For <code>while</code> loops without such duplicated code, the quick fix is offered in the editor as well, but without highlighting.

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  foo();
  while (x) {
      foo();
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Can be replaced with:</p>
<pre><code>
  do {
    foo();
  } while (x);
</code></pre>
