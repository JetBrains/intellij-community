Reports assignments whose right side is a division that shouldn't be truncated to integer.
<p>While occasionally intended, this construction is often buggy.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  int x = 18;
  x *= 3/2; // doesn't change x because of the integer division result
</code></pre>
<p>
This code should be replaced with:
<pre><code>
  int x = 18;
  x *= 3.0/2;
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  In the inspection options, you can disable warnings for suspicious but possibly correct divisions,
  for example, when the dividend can't be calculated statically.
<pre><code>
  void calc(int d) {
     int x = 18;
     x *= d/2;
  }
</code></pre>
