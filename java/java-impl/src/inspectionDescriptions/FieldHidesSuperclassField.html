Reports fields in a derived class that are named identically a field of a superclass.
Java fields cannot be overridden in derived classes,
so the field in the derived class will hide the field from the superclass.
<p>
  As a result of such naming, you may accidentally use the field of the derived class
  where the identically named field of a base class is intended.
</p>
<p>A quick-fix is suggested to rename the field in the derived class.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>class Parent {
  Parent parent;
}
class Child extends Parent {
  Child parent;
}
</code></pre>

  You can configure the following options for this inspection:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Ignore non-accessible fields</strong> - indicates whether this inspection should report all name clashes,
    or only clashes with fields which are visible from the subclass.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ignore static fields hiding static fields</strong> - ignore <code>static</code> fields
    which hide <code>static</code> fields in base classes.
  </li>
</ol>
