Reports calls to <code>Thread.stop()</code>,
<code>Thread.suspend()</code>, and <code>Thread.resume()</code>.
<p>
  These calls are inherently prone to data corruption and deadlocks, and their use is strongly discouraged.
  It is better to use cooperative cancellation instead of <code>stop</code>, and
  interruption instead of direct calls to <code>suspend</code> and <code>resume</code>.
