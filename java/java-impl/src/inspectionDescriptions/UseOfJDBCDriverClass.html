Reports uses of specific JDBC driver classes. Use of such classes will
bind your project to a specific database and driver, defeating the purpose of JDBC and
resulting in loss of portability.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  import java.sql.Driver;

  abstract class Sample implements Driver {
    public void foo() {
        Sample sample;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
