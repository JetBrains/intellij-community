Reports classes or interfaces that can be replaced with an implementation or extension of a more specific commonly used class or interface.
<p>For this inspection to work, a superclass needs to be in project source files and the project needs to use the IntelliJ IDEA build system.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class MyInheritor implements A {} // B suggested on the A reference

  interface A {}

  abstract class B implements A {}

  abstract class C1 extends B {}
  abstract class C2 extends B {}
  abstract class C3 extends B {}
  abstract class C4 extends B {}
  abstract class C5 extends B {}
</code></pre>

<p>By default, this inspection doesn't highlight issues in the editor but only provides a quick-fix.</p>
