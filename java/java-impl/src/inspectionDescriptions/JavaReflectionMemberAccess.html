This inspection detects reflective access to fields and methods which don't exist or aren't visible.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  With a 'final' class it's clear if there's a field or method with the specified name in the class.
</p>
<p>
  With non-final classes it's possible that a subclass has a field or method with that name, so there could be false positives.
  You may use the inspection settings to get rid of such false positives, everywhere or with specific classes.
