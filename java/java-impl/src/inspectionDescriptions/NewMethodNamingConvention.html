Reports methods whose names are too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern.
<p>Instance methods that override library
  methods and constructors are ignored by this inspection.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> if the inspection is enabled for static methods, and the minimum specified method name length is 4 (the default),
  the following static method produces a warning, because the length of its name is 3, which is less
  than 4: <code>public static int max(int a, int b)</code>.
<p>A quick-fix that renames such methods is available only in the editor.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<p>Use the list in the <b>Options</b> section to specify which methods should be checked. Deselect the checkboxes for the method types for which
  you want to skip the check. Specify <b>0</b> in the length fields to skip the corresponding checks.</p>
<p>Regular expressions should be specified in the standard <code>java.util.regex</code> format.</p>
