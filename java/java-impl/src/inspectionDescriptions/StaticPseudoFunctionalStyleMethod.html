Inspection detects usages of pseudo-functional code if Java Stream API is available.
<br/>
Consider cases when monad behaviour is emulated by static method call:
<br/>
<code>
List&lt;String&gt; transformedIterable = Iterables.transform(someList, someTransformFunction);
</code>
<br>
Note, that code semantic could be changed, for example: guava's <b>Iterable.transform</b> produce lazy-evaluated iterable
but replacement produced by quick fix will be eager-evaluated.
<br>
This inspection only reports if the project
or module is configured to use a language level
of 8 or higher.
