This inspection reports usages of deprecated API (classes, fields, and methods) which are marked for removal with
<code>@Deprecated(<b>forRemoval</b>=true)</code>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  The code that uses API marked for removal may cause a runtime error with a future version of the API.<br>
  The recommended severity of this inspection is <i>Error</i> to emphasize that.
<p>
  You may change the severity of this inspection to <i>Warning</i> if you want the same text decoration as ordinary deprecation has.
