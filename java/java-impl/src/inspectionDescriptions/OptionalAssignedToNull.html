This inspection warns when <code>null</code> is assigned to <code>Optional</code> variable or returned from method returning
  <code>Optional</code>. It's recommended to use <code>Optional.empty()</code> (or <code>Optional.absent()</code> for Guava) to denote
  an empty value.
<p>
  Use checkbox below to report also comparisons like <b>optional == null</b>. While in rare cases (e.g. lazily initialized optional field)
  this might be correct, usually optional variable is never null, and probably <b>optional.isPresent()</b> was intended.
