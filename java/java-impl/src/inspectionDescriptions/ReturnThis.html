Reports methods returning <code>this</code>.
<p>
  While such a return is valid, it is rarely necessary, and usually indicates that the method is intended to be used
  as part of a chain of similar method calls (for example, <code>buffer.append("foo").append("bar").append("baz")</code>).
  Such chains are frowned upon by many coding standards.

<pre><code>
  public Builder append(String str) {
    // [...]
    return this;
  }
</code></pre>
