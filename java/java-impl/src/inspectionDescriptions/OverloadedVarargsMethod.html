Reports varargs methods with the same name as other methods in the class or in a superclass.
Overloaded methods that take a variable number of arguments can be very confusing
because it is often unclear which overload gets called.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
    public void execute(Runnable... r) {} // warning
    public void execute(Runnable r1, Runnable r2) {}
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the option to ignore overloaded methods whose parameter types are definitely incompatible.
