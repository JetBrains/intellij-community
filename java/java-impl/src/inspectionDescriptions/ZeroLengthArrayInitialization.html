Reports allocations of arrays with known lengths of zero.
<p>
  Since array lengths in Java are non-modifiable, it is almost always possible to share zero-length arrays, rather than repeatedly
  allocate new ones. Such sharing may provide useful optimizations in the program runtime or footprint.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the inspection does not report zero-length arrays allocated as static final fields,
  since those arrays are assumed to be used for implementing array sharing.
