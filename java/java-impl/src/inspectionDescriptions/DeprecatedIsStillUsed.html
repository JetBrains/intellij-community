Reports deprecated classes, methods, and fields that are used in your code nonetheless.
<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>
  class MyCode {
    @Deprecated
    void oldMethod() {}// warning: "Deprecated member is still used"

    void newMethod() {
      oldMethod(); // forgotten usage
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Usages within deprecated elements are ignored.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Due to performance reasons, a non-private member is checked only when its name rarely occurs in the project.</p>
