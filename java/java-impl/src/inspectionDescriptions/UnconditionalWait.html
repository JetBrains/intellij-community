Reports <code>wait()</code> being called unconditionally within a synchronized context.
<p>
  Normally, <code>wait()</code> is used to block a thread until some condition is true. If
  <code>wait()</code> is called unconditionally, it often indicates that the condition was
  checked before a lock was acquired. In that case a data race may occur, with the condition
  becoming true between the time it was checked and the time the lock was acquired.

  While constructs found by this inspection are not necessarily incorrect, they are certainly worth examining.

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Bar {
      void foo() throws InterruptedException {
          synchronized (this) {
              wait(); // warning
          }
      }
  }
</code></pre>
