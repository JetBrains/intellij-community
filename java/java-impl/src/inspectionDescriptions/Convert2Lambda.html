  Reports all anonymous classes which can be replaced with lambda expressions.
  <p>
    Note that if an anonymous class is converted into a stateless lambda, the same lambda object 
    can be reused by Java runtime during subsequent invocations. On the other hand, when an anonymous class is used,
    separate objects are created every time. Thus, applying the quick-fix can cause the semantics change in rare cases, 
    e.g. when anonymous class instances are used as <code>HashMap</code> keys.

  Lambda syntax is not supported under Java 1.7 or earlier JVMs.
