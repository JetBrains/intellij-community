Reports classes that refer to their subclasses in static initializers or static fields.
<p>Such references can cause JVM-level deadlocks in multithreaded environment, when one thread tries to load the superclass
  and another thread tries to load the subclass at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Parent {
    static final Child field = new Child();
  }
  class Child extends Parent { }
</code></pre>
