Reports anonymous inner classes whose total complexity exceeds the specified maximum.
<p>The total complexity of a class is the sum of cyclomatic complexities of all the methods
  and initializers the class declares. Inherited methods and initializers are not counted
  toward the total complexity.</p>
<p>Anonymous classes should have very low complexity otherwise they are hard to understand and should be promoted to become named inner classes.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Use the <b>Cyclomatic complexity limit</b> field to specify the maximum allowed complexity for a class.</p>
