Reports text blocks indented using both spaces and tabs.
Such cases produce unexpected results since spaces and tabs are treated equally during text block processing.

<p>In the following example, spaces and tabs are visualized as <code>·</code> and <code>␉</code> respectively, and a tab is equal to 4 spaces in the editor:</p>
<pre><code>
String colors = """
········red
␉   ␉   green
········blue""";
</code></pre>

<p>After printing such string, the result would be:</p>
<pre><code>
red
······green
blue
</code></pre>
<p>After the compiler removes 2 spaces or tabs from the beginning of each line, the lines end up with extra whitespaces at the beginning.</p>
