Reports text blocks that are indented using both spaces and tabs.
Such cases produce unexpected results since spaces and tabs are treated equally by the text block processing.
<p>In the following example, spaces and tabs are visualized as <code>·</code> and <code>␉</code> respectively,
and a tab is equal to 4 spaces in the editor.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
String colors = """
········red
␉   ␉   green
········blue""";
</code></pre>

<p>After printing such a string, the result will be:</p>
<pre><code>
······red
green
······blue
</code></pre>
<p>After the compiler removes an equal amount of spaces or tabs from the beginning of each line,
some lines remain with leading spaces.</p>
