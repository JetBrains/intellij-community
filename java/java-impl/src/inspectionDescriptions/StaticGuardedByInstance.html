                This inspection reports any @GuardedBy annotations (net.jcip.annotations|javax.annotation.concurrent|org.apache.http.annotation) on static fields or methods,
                where the guard is either a non-static field or 'this'. Guarding a static by a non-static may result in
                excessive concurrency, multiple threads may be able to access the guarded field simultaneously, by locking in different object contexts.
