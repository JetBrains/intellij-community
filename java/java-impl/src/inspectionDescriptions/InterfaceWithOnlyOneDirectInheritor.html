Reports interfaces that have precisely one direct inheritor.
While such interfaces may offer admirable clarity of design,
in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments,
they needlessly increase the total footprint of the application. Consider
merging the interface with its inheritor.
<p>
  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
