Reports classes which do not have a declared logger.
<p>Ensuring that every class has a dedicated logger is an important step in providing a unified logging
  implementation for an application. Interfaces, enumerations, annotations, inner classes, and abstract classes are not reported by this inspection.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
  <b>public class</b> NoLoggerDeclared {

    <b>int</b> calculateNthDigitOfPi(<b>int</b> n) {
      // todo
      <b>return</b> 1;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the table in the <b>Options</b> section to specify logger class names.
Classes which do not declare a field with the type of one of the specified classes will be reported by this inspection.
