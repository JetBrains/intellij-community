<p>Reports annotations on the record components that have no effect. This may happen in two cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Annotation has METHOD target but the corresponding accessor is explicitly defined</li>
  <li>Annotation has PARAMETER target but the canonical constructor is explicitly defined</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@interface A { }
  
// The annotation will not appear in bytecode at all,
// as it should be propagated to the accessor but accessor is explicitly defined 
record R(@A int x) {
  public int x() { return x; }
}
</pre>
