Reports classes whose names are prefixed with their package names, ignoring differences in
capitalization.
<p>While occasionally having such names is reasonable, they are often used due to a poor naming scheme, may be redundant and
  annoying.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b>
  <pre><code>
  package byteCode;
  class ByteCodeAnalyzer {}
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such classes is available only in the editor.</p>
