Suggests extracting fragments of code to a separate method to make code more clear. 
This inspection has a number of heuristics to select good candidates for extraction,
including the following ones.
<ul>
  <li>The extracted fragment has no non-local control flow</li>
  <li>The extracted fragment has exactly one output variable</li>
  <li>There are no similar uses of output variable inside the extracted fragment and outside it</li>
  <li>The extracted fragment has only few input parameters (no more than three by default; configured with the inspection option)</li>
  <li>The extracted fragment is not smaller than the configured length (500 characters by default) but no bigger than 60% of the containing method body</li>
</ul>
