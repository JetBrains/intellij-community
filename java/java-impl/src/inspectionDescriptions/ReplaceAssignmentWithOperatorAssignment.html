Reports assignment operations which can be replaced by operator-assignment.
<p>Code using operator assignment is shorter and may be clearer.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>  x = x + 3;
  x = x / 3;
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>  x += 3;
  x /= 3;
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the <b>Ignore conditional operators</b> option to ignore <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
and <code>||</code>. Replacing conditional operators with operator
assignment would change the evaluation from lazy to eager, which may change the semantics of the expression.
</p>
<p>
Use the <b>Ignore obscure operators</b> option to ignore <code>^</code> and <code>%</code>, which are less known.
