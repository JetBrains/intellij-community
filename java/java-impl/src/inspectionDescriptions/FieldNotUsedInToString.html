Reports any fields which are not used in the <b>toString()</b> method of a class. This can be useful to discover
fields that were added after the <b>toString()</b> method was created and for which the <b>toString()</b> method was not
correctly adjusted. It is possible to exclude fields from this check in the settings accessible via the Generate > toString() dialog.
<p>
  This inspection will also check for problems with getter methods if 'enable getters in code generation' is enabled
  in settings.
