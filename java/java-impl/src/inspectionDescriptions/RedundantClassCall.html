Reports redundant calls of <code>java.lang.Class</code> methods.
<p>For example, <code>Xyz.class.isInstance(object)</code> can be replaced with <code>object instanceof Xyz</code>.
The instanceof check is preferred: even though the performance will probably be the same as these methods are intrinsics,
they better indicate a static check.</p>
