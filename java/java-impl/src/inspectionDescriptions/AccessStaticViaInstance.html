Reports references to <code>static</code> methods and fields via a class instance rather than the class itself.
<p>Even though referring to static members via instance variables is allowed by The Java Language Specification,
  this makes the code confusing as the reader may think that the result of the method depends on the instance.</p>
<p>The quick-fix replaces the instance variable with the class name.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  String s1 = s.valueOf(0);
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  String s = String.valueOf(0);
</code></pre>
