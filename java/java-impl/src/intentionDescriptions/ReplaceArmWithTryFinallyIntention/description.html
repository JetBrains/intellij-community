Replaces an Automatic Resource Management block
with a regular <code>try finally</code> construct.
<p>If the ARM block has no <code>catch</code> section, the entire
block is replaced. If the ARM does have a <code>catch</code> section, it is converted to a normal
<code>try catch</code> block and the <code>try finally</code> construct is placed inside.</p>
