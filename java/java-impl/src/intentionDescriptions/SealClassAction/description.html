Makes a class final if it does not have subclasses.
<p>If there are subclasses, the intention converts the class into a sealed class and provides a list of its subclasses in the
  <code>permits</code> clause (for subclasses in other compilation units).
  If the subclasses are not marked as <code>sealed</code> / <code>non-sealed</code> / <code>final</code>, the <code>non-sealed</code>
  modifier is automatically applied to them.</p>
