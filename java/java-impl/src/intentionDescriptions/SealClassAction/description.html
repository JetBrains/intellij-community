Makes the class final if it doesnâ€™t have subclasses.
If there are subclasses, the intention converts the class to sealed and provides the list of the subclasses in the permits clause
(for subclasses in other compilation units).
If the subclasses are not marked as 'sealed'/'non-sealed'/'final', the 'non-sealed' modifier is automatically applied to them.
