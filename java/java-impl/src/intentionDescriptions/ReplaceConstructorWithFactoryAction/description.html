Replaces constructor calls with calls to the factory method.
<p>
Since factory methods can create objects of any type, such replacement can be especially useful when a new instance of the containing class is not desired.

E.g.
when current class is extended and objects of subclasses should be created instead.
Or when caching is introduced and existing objects should be returned.
