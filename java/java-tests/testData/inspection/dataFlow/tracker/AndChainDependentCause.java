Value is always false (a > 5 && b < 0 && b > a)

    Operand #1 of &&-chain is false (a > 5)
    or operand #2 of &&-chain is false (b < 0)
    or operand #3 of &&-chain is false (b > a)
      Left operand is <= -1 (b)
        Range is known from line #15 (b < 0)
      and right operand is >= 6 (a)
        Range is known from line #15 (a > 5)
