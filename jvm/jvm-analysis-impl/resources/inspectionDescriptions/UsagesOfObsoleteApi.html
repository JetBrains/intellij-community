Reports declarations (classes, methods, fields) annotated as <code>@ApiStatus.Obsolete</code>.
<p>
  Sometimes it's impossible to delete the current API, though it might not work correctly, there is a newer, or better, or more generic API.
  This way, it's a weaker variant of <code>@Deprecated</code> annotation.
  The annotated API is not supposed to be used in the new code, but it's permitted to postpone the migration of the existing code,
  therefore the usage is not considered a warning.
