Reports declarations of classes, methods, and fields that reference an unstable API type in the signature,
but are not marked with the same unstable annotation.
<p>
  This inspection ensures that the signatures of a public API do not expose any <i>unstable</i> (internal, experimental) types.
  For example, if a method returns an <i>experimental</i> class, the method itself is considered <i>experimental</i>
  because incompatible changes of the type (deletion or move to another package) lead to incompatible method signature changes.
