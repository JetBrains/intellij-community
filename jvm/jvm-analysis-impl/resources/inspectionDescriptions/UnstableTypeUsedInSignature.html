<p>
  Reports declarations of classes, methods and fields that reference an unstable API type in the signature
  but are not marked with the same unstable annotation. Set of checked annotations' names is specified below.
</p>
This inspection may be useful to check that no <i>unstable (internal, experimental)</i> types are exposed in signatures of public API.
For example, if an <i>experimental</i> class is used as the return type of a method, the method is also considered <i>experimental</i>
because incompatible changes of the type (deletion or move to another package) lead to incompatible method signature changes.
