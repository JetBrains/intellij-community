<p>
  Reports classes, interfaces and methods that extend, implement or override API elements marked with <code>@ApiStatus.NonExtendable</code>
  annotation.
</p>
<code>@ApiStatus.NonExtendable</code> annotation indicates that the annotated API class, interface or method <strong>must not be extended,
  implemented or overridden</strong>. Instances of classes and interfaces marked with this annotation may be cast to an internal
implementing class in the library code,
leading to <code>ClassCastException</code> if a different implementation is provided by client. New abstract methods may be added to such
classes and interfaces breaking compatibility with client's implementations.
