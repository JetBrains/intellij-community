Reports classes, interfaces and methods that extend, implement, or override API elements marked with <code>@ApiStatus.NonExtendable</code>.
<p>
  The <code>@ApiStatus.NonExtendable</code> annotation indicates that the class, interface, or method <strong>must not be extended, 
  implemented, or overridden</strong>.
  Since casting such interfaces and classes to the internal library implementation is rather common,
  if a client provides a different implementation, you will get <code>ClassCastException</code>.
  Adding new abstract methods to such classes and interfaces will break the compatibility with the client's implementations.
