Reports non-<code>abstract</code> test cases without any test methods. Such test cases usually indicate unfinished code or could be a
refactoring leftover that should be removed.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  public class CrucialTest {
    @Before
    public void setUp() {
      System.out.println("setting up");
    }
  }
</code></pre>
