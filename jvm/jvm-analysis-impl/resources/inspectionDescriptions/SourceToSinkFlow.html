Reports cases when a non-safe string is passed to a method with a parameter marked with <code>@Untainted</code> annotations, returned from
annotated methods or assigned to annotated fields, parameters, or local variables. Kotlin `set` and `get` methods for fields are not
supported as entry points.
<p>
  A safe object is:
<ul>
  <li>a string literal, interface instance, or enum object</li>
  <li>a result of a call of a method that is marked as <code>@Untainted</code></li>
  <li>a private field, which is assigned only with a string literal and has a safe initializer</li>
  <li>a final field, which has a safe initializer</li>
  <li>local variable or parameter that are marked as <code>@Untainted</code> and are not assigned from non-safe objects</li>
  This field, local variable, or parameter must not be passed as arguments to methods or used as a qualifier or must be a primitive, its
  wrapper or immutable.
</ul>
<p>
  The analysis is performed only inside one file. To process dependencies from other classes, use options.
  The analysis extends to private or static methods and has a limit of depth propagation.
<p>
  Example:
<pre>
<code lang="java">
  void doSmth(boolean b) {
    String s = safe();
    String s1 = "other";
    if (b) s1 = s;
    sink(s);
  }

  String sink(@Untainted String s) {}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here we do not have non-safe string assignments to <code>s</code> so a warning is not produced. On the other hand:
<pre>
<code lang="java">
  void doSmth(boolean b) {
    String s = safe();
    String s1 = "other";
    s1 = foo();
    if (b) s = s1;
    sink(s);        // warning here
  }

  String foo();

  String sink(@Untainted String s) {}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here we have a warning since <code>s1</code> has an unknown state after <code>foo</code> call result assignment.

    <p>Use the <b>Untainted annotations</b> table to specify annotations, which will be used as <code>@Untainted</code> annotations during
      the analysis.
      The first annotation from this list will be used for propagation if it exists in the classpath.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Tainted annotations</b> table to specify annotations, which will be used as <code>@Tainted</code> annotations during the
      analysis
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <b>Consider external methods untainted if receivers and arguments are untainted</b> option is enabled,
      then external methods outside the current class will be considered as safe if their receivers and arguments are safe.
      In some cases, it is not applicable, but it can be useful for stateless classes.
      If this option is disabled, then all external methods will be considered as unsafe.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Safe classes</b> option to specify classes, expressions with this type will be considered safe
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Untainted methods</b> table to specify methods, which return only safe objects
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Untainted fields</b> table to specify fields, which contain only safe objects
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Report if case is too complex to check</b> option to specify if it is needed to report strings, which can not be checked
      because of the complexity
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Consider parameters of private methods as safe</b> option to specify that parameters of private methods, otherwise they
      will be considered as unknown.
  </li>
