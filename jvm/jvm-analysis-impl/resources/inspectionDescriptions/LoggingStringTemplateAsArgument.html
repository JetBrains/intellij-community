Reports string templates that are used as arguments to <b>SLF4J</b> and <b>Log4j 2</b> logging methods.
The method <code>org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.log()</code> and its overloads are supported only for <b>all log levels</b> option.
String templates are evaluated at runtime even when the logging message is not logged; this can negatively impact performance.
It is recommended to use a parameterized log message instead, which will not be evaluated when logging is disabled.
<p><b>Example (for Kotlin):</b></p>
<pre><code lang="kotlin">
      val variable1 = getVariable()
      logger.info("variable1: $variable1")
</code></pre>
<p><b>After the quick-fix is applied (for Kotlin):</b></p>
<pre><code lang="kotlin">
      val variable1 = getVariable()
      logger.info("variable1: {}", variable1)
</code></pre>
<p>
  Note that the suggested replacement might not be equivalent to the original code, for example,
  when string templates contain method calls or assignment expressions.

<ul>
  <li>
    Use the <b>Warn on</b> list to ignore certain higher logging levels. Higher logging levels may be always enabled, and the arguments will always be evaluated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the <b>Do not warn when only expressions with primitive types, their wrappers or String are included</b> option to ignore
    string templates, which contain only expressions with primitive types, their wrappers or String.
    For example, it could be useful to prevent loading lazy collections.
    Note that, creating string even only with expressions with primitive types,
    their wrappers or String at runtime can negatively impact performance.
  </li>
</ul>
