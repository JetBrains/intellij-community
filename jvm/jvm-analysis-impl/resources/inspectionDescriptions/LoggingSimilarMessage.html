Reports SLF4J, Log4j2 logging calls in one class, such as <code>logger.info("message: {}", key)</code> with similar log messages.
These calls can be non-distinguishable from each other, and this introduces difficulties to understand where a certain log message is coming from.
<p><b>Example (for Java):</b></p>
<pre><code lang="java">
  private static void request1(String text) {
      log.info("Message: {}", text); //similar call
      doSomething1();
  }

  private static void request2(int i) {
      log.info("Message: {}", i); //similar call
      doSomething2();
  }
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the <b>Minimum length of a similar sequence</b> option to set the minimum length of similar sequences after which calls will be reported
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the <b>Do not report calls with the 'error' log level</b> option to ignore messages with `error` log level and when there is an exception.
    It may be useful to hide the warnings, because call sites can still be located using stack traces
  </li>
</ul>
