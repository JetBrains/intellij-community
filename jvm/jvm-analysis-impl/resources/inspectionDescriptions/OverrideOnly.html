<p>
  Reports invocations of API methods marked with <code>@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly</code> annotation.
</p>
<code>@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly</code> indicates that the annotated method is part of SPI (Service Provider Interface),
which is intended to be <strong>only implemented or overridden</strong> but not called by clients of the declaring library.
If a class or interface is marked with this annotation it means that all its methods can be only overridden.
