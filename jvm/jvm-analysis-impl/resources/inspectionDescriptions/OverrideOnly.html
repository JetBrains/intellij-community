Reports calls to API methods marked with an <code>@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly</code> annotation.
An <code>@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly</code> indicates that the annotated method is part of SPI (Service Provider Interface),
which is intended to be <strong>only implemented or overridden</strong> but not called by clients of the declaring library.
If a class or interface is marked with this annotation, it means that all its methods can be only overridden.
