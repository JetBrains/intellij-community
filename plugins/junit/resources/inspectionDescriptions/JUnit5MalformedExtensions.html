Reports fields annotated with <code>@RegisterExtension</code> which have a wrong type or are not declared as static when it's required.
Such extensions won't be registered correctly and could lead to test startup failures.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public class MyTest {
    @RegisterExtension
    private JUnit4Rule rule;
  }
</code></pre>
