Reports usages of static imports for Lombok's generated methods.<br>
<p>
  This will fail on compilation with javac. The reason is that static methods are resolved before the lombok annotation processor kicks in.
  At this time javac uses the original code before the one that should have been generated by the annotation processor, then javac of course
  report the missing symbols (generated methods).
