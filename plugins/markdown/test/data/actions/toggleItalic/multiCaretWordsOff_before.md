An _<selection>h1<caret></selection>_ header
============

Paragraphs are _<selection>separated<caret></selection>_ by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this _<selection>one<caret></selection>_
  * that _<selection>one<caret></selection>_
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block _<selection>quotes<caret></selection>_ are
> _<selection>written<caret></selection>_ like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you _<selection>like<caret></selection>_.
