<p>Ordered list items are expected to have straight numeration starting from 1.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this is that most of Markdown processors are ignoring the numbering of ordered lists. A processor will generate an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element for such list, that will number items continuously from 1.</p>
