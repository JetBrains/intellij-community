        This inspecton Checks whether a method without any <code>@Pattern</code> or derived annotation overrides an annotated
        method from its base classes. This is not necessary for the error-highlighting inside the editor, however the
        runtime-check instrumentation doesn't pick up annotations from base-class methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        A QuickFix is provided to add an annotation that matches the one from the base-class method. This ensures the
        runtime-check instrumentation works correctly.
