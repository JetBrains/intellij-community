This inspection checks for deprecated keys in YAML files<br>
Deprecation is checked only if there exists a JSON schema associated with corresponding YAML file.<br>
Note that deprecation mechanism is not defined in the JSON Schema specification yet,
and this inspection uses a non-standard extension 'deprecationMessage'.
