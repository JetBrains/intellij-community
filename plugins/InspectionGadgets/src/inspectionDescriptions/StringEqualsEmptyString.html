Reports cases when <b>.equals()</b> is called to compare a String with an empty string. In this case, using <b>.isEmpty()</b> is better as
it shows you exactly what you're checking.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  <b>"".equals(str)</b> returns false when <b>str</b> is null. For safety, this inspection's quick fix inserts an explicit null-check when 
  the <b>equals()</b> argument is nullable. Use the checkbox below to suppress the warning in this case.
