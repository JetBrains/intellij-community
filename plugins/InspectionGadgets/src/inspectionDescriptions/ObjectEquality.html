Reports any use of <b>==</b> or <b>!=</b>
to test for Object equality, rather than the <b>equals()</b> method.
Note that comparison of Strings or Numbers using <b>==</b> is not reported by this
inspection, nor is the comparison of an object to <b>null</b> using
<b>==</b>, or the comparison of two array objects.

<p>
Use the checkboxes below to indicate whether uses of <b>==</b> between objects of
an enumerated type, class type or types with private constructors should be reported by this inspection.
