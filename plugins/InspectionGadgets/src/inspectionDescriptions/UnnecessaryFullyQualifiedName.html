Reports on fully qualified class names which can be shortened. The quick fix for this

<p>
In <code>Settings | Code Style | Java | Imports</code> two settings can be found which influence this inspection.
Use the settings there to  specify if references to inner classes
should be qualified with the outer class and if fully qualified names are allowed in javadoc.
