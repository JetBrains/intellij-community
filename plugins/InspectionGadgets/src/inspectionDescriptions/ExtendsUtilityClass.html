Reports any classes explicitly declared to extend a utility class.
<p>
An utility class is a non-empty class in which the fields and methods are all static.
</p>
<p>
  Extending a utility class also allows inadvertent object instantiation of the
  utility class, because to allow extension the constructor can not be made private.

  Use the checkbox below to ignore any classes that override a utility class but are
  also utility classes themselves.
