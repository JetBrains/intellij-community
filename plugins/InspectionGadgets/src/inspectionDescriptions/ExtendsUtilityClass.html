Reports any classes explicitly declared to extend a utility class. Utility classes
have all fields and methods declared <b>static</b>. Extending a utility
class also allows inadvertent object instantiation of the utility class, because to allow extension
the constructor can not be made private.

Use the checkbox below to ignore any classes that override a utility class but are also utility classes themselves.
