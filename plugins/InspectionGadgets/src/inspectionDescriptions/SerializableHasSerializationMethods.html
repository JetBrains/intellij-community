Reports <b>Serializable</b> classes
which do not provide <b>readObject</b> and
<b>writeObject</b> methods. If <b>readObject</b>
and <b>writeObject</b> methods are not provided, the default serialization
algorithms are used, which may be sub-optimal in many environments for performance and compatibility
purposes.

<p>
Use the table below to specify what specific classes and inheritors should be excluded
from being checked by this inspection. This is meant for those classes which, although they inherit
Serializable from a superclass, are not intended for serialization. Such classes would lead this
inspection to report unnecessarily.
