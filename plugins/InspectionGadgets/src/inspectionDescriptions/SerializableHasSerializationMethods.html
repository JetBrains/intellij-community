Reports <code>Serializable</code> classes
which do not provide <code>readObject</code> and <code>writeObject</code> methods.
If <code>readObject</code> and <code>writeObject</code> methods are not provided,
the default serialization algorithms are used,
which may be sub-optimal in many environments for performance and compatibility purposes.

<p>
Use the table below to specify what specific classes and inheritors should be excluded
from being checked by this inspection. This is meant for those classes which, although they inherit
<code>Serializable</code> from a superclass, are not intended for serialization. Such classes would lead this
inspection to report unnecessarily.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore <code>Serializable</code> classes without non-static fields.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore <code>Serializable</code> anonymous classes.
