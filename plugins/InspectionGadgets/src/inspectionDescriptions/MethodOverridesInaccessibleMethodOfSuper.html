Reports methods with the same signature as an inaccessible method from super class, e.g. package-private method of super class in another package or private method.
Such methods may result in confusing semantics, particularly if the super method is ever made
publicly visible. A package-private method can only properly be overridden if
the subclass resides in the same package. Private methods can't be overridden.
