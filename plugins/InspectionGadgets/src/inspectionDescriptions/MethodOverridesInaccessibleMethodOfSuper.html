Reports methods with the same signature as an inaccessible method from super class, e.g. package-private method of super class
in another package or private method.
Such methods may result in confusing semantics, particularly if the super method is ever made
publicly visible. A package-private method can only properly be overridden if
the subclass resides in the same package. Private methods can't be overridden.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  package pack1;
  public class Super {
    private void test() {
    }
  }

  package pack2;
  public class Sub extends Super {
    void test() { // making 'Super.test()' 'public' causes the compilation error
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>Quick-fix is provided to rename the method.</p>
