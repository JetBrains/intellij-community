<p>Reports methods that are named identically to their class.</p>
<p>While such naming is allowed by the Java language, it's usually a mistake, as it was intended to create a constructor.
Such naming is bad practice.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class MyClass {
    int val;

    // Method MyClass named identically to its containing class.
    // Likely, 'void' was added by mistake.
    void MyClass(int val) {
      this.val = val;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>When appropriate, a quick-fix converts the method to a constructor:</p>
<pre><code>
  class MyClass {
    int val;

    MyClass(int val) {
      this.val = val;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Another quick-fix renames the method.</p>
