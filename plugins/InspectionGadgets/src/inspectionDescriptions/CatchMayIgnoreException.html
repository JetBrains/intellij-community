Reports <b>catch</b> blocks which are empty or may ignore exception.
While occasionally intended, empty <b>catch</b> blocks can make debugging extremely difficult.
Also ignoring catch parameter could be wrong. Finally it will be reported if it's statically detected
that catch block may silently ignore important VM exceptions like <b>NullPointerException</b>. Ignoring such exception
(without logging or rethrowing it) may hide a bug.
<p>
  This inspection will not report any <b>catch</b> parameters named "ignore" or "ignored".
  Conversely this inspection will warn on any<b>catch</b> parameters named "ignore" or "ignored" that are actually used.
  Also <b>catch</b> parameters named "expected" or "ok" are not reported inside test sources.
