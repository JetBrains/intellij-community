This inspection reports any methods which are not <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>,
    <b><font color="#000080">private</font></b>, <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">abstract</font></b>,
    and whose bodies are not empty.  Coding in a style that avoids such methods protects
    the contracts of classes from being broken by their subclasses.  The cost of this style is that subclasses are limited
    in their flexibility, in particular they cannot prevent execution of code in the
    superclass. The benefit of svoiding such methods is subclasses cannot
    corrupt the state of the superclass by forgetting to call the super method.
<p>
    This inspection is intended for code to be used in secure environments, and is probably not
    appropriate for less restrictive environments.
