Reports calls to and implementations of the <b>clone()</b> method and uses of <b>java.lang.Cloneable</b>.
Some coding standards prohibit <b>clone()</b> usage, and recommend using a copy constructor or <b>static</b> factory method.
Calls to <b>clone()</b> on arrays are ignored, because that is a common, correct, efficient and compact way to copy an array.
