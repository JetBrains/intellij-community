Reports any call to <b>toArray()</b>
on an object of type or subtype <b>java.util.Collection</b>
with a zero-length array argument. When passing in an array of too small size, the 
<b>toArray()</b> method has to construct a new array of
the right size using reflection. On older JVMs this has worse performance than passing
in an array of at least the size of the collection itself.
