Reports synchronization on a call to <b>getClass()</b>.
If the class containing the synchronization is subclassed, the subclass will synchronize on a different class object.
Usually the call to <b>getClass()</b> can be replaced with a class literal expression, for example <b>String.class</b>.
An even better solution is synchronizing on a <b>private static final</b> lock object, access to which can be completely controlled.
