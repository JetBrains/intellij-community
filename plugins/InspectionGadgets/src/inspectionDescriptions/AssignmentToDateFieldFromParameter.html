Reports any attempt to assign a <b>java.lang.Date</b> or
<b>java.lang.Calendar</b> field from a method parameter.
Since <b>Date</b> or <b>Calendar</b> are often
treated as immutable values but are actually mutable, assigning to such a field from a method parameter may
result in an object having its state modified unexpectedly. While occasionally useful for performance
reasons, this construct is inherently bug-prone.
