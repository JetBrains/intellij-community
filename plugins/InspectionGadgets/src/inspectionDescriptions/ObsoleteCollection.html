Reports any uses of <b>java.util.Vector</b>
, <b>java.util.Hashtable</b> and <b>java.util.Stack</b>.
Usages of these classes can most often be replaced by uses of
<b>java.util.ArrayList</b>, <b>java.util.HashMap</b> and <b>java.util.ArrayDeque</b> respectively.
While still supported,
the former classes were made obsolete by the JDK1.2 collection classes, and should probably
not be used in new development.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore any cases where the obsolete collections are used
as an argument to a method or assigned to a variable that requires the obsolete type.
Enabling this option is potentially quite processor intensive.
