Reports any uses of <b>java.util.Vector</b>
or <b>java.util.Hashtable</b>. While still supported,
these classes were made obsolete by the JDK1.2 collection classes, and should probably
not be used in new development.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore any cases where the obsolete collections are used
as an argument to a method or assigned to a variable that requires the obsolete type.
Enabling this option is potentially quite processor intensive.
