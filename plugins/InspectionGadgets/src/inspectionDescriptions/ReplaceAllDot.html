Reports any calls to
<b>java.lang.String.replaceAll()</b> with <b>"."</b>
as the first argument. Calling <b>replaceAll(".", ...)</b> replaces
all of the characters in a string with its second argument, which is rarely the desired functionality.
More probably, <b>replaceAll("\.", ...)</b> was intended.
