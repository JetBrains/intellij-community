Reports any calls to
<b>String.replaceAll()</b> or <b>String.split()</b> where the first argument is a single regex meta character argument.
The regex meta characters are one of ".$|()[{^?*+\", and these have a special meaning in regular expressions.
For example calling <b>"ab.cd".replaceAll(".", "-")</b> produces <b>"-----"</b>, because the dot matches any character.
Most likely the escaped variant <b>"\\."</b> was intended instead.
