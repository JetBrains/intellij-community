Reports 'if' statements which can be replaced with condition using '&&', '||' or '?:' operator.
The result is usually shorter, but not always more clear, so it's not advised to apply it everywhere.
Also this change may reduce compiled bytecode size which could be useful in some environments like Java ME.
<p>
  Example: <b>if (<i>condition</i>) return true; else return <i>foo</i>;</b> could be replaced with
  <b>return <i>condition</i> || <i>foo</i>;</b>
</p>

  Use the first checkbox to skip warning when '?:' operator is suggested. In this case only '&&' and '||' suggestions
  will be highlighted. The fix action to replace with '?:' will still be available in the editor.

  Use the second checkbox to skip warning on 'if-else' chains. The fix action will still be available in the editor.
