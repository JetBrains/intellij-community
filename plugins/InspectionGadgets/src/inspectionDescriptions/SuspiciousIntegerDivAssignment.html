Reports cases when the right side of the assignment is a division that shouldn't be truncated to integer.
<p>
  For example, the following code doesn't change <b>x</b> because of the integer division result:
<pre><code>
  <b>int</b> x = 18;
  x *= 3/2;
</code></pre>
So, it should be replaced with:
<pre><code>
  <b>int</b> x = 18;
  x *= 3.0/2;
</code></pre>
