Reports calls to <code>wait()</code> made on a <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</code>
object. This is probably a programming error, and some variant of the <code>await()</code> method was intended instead.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException {
    while (acquired) {
      released.wait();
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Good code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>
  void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException {
    while (acquired) {
      released.await();
    }
  }
</code></pre>
