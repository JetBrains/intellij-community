Reports on any call to <code>wait()</code> made on a <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</code>
object. This is probably a programming error, and some variant of the <code>await()</code> method was intended instead.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException {
  while (acquired) {
    released.wait();
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
Good code would look like this:
<pre><code>void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException {
  while (acquired) {
    released.await();
  }
}</code></pre>
