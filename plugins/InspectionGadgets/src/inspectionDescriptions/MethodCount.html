This inspection reports any classes with too many methods.  Classes with
a large number of methods are often trying to 'do too much', and may need to be
refactored into multiple smaller classes.
<p>
Use the field provided below to specify the maximum acceptable number of methods
a class might have.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if simple getters and setters should be ignored
in the method count.
