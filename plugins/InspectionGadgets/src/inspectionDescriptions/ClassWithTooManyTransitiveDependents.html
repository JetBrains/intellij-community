Reports any classes on which too many other classes are directly or indirectly dependent. Such classes may be expensive to modify,
as changes to the class may require changing many other classes. Only top-level classes
are reported by this inspection.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
