This global inspection reports any classes on which too many other classes in your
project are directly or indirectly dependent. Such classes may be expensive to modify,
as changes to the class may require changing many other classes. Only top-level classes
are reported by this inspection.
Since this inspection requires global code analysis, it is only available in batch inspection mode.

a class may have before triggering this inspection
