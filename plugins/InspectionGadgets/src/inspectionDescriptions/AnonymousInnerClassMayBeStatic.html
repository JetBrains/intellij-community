Reports the anonymous classes that may be safely replaced with static inner classes.
An anonymous class may be a static inner class if it doesn't explicitly reference its enclosing instance or local classes from its surrounding method.
<p>
A static inner class does not keep an implicit reference to its enclosing instance.
This prevents a common cause of memory leaks and uses less memory per class instance.
</p>
<p>The quick-fix extracts the anonymous class into a named static inner class.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  <code>
  void sample(){
    Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
      }
    });
  }
  </code>
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
  void sample(){
    Thread thread = new Thread(new Task());
  }

  private static class Task implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
    }
  }
  </code>
