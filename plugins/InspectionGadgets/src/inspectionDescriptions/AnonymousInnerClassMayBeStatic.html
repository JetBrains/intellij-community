Reports any anonymous classes which may safely be made into a named <b>static</b> inner class.
An anonymous class may be <b>static</b> if it doesn't explicitly reference its enclosing instance or local classes from its surrounding method.
<p>
A <b>static</b> inner class does not keep an implicit reference to its enclosing instance.
This prevents a common cause of memory leaks and uses less memory per instance of the class.
