Reports any I/O resource which is not safely closed in a <b>finally</b> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed. I/O resources checked
by this inspection include <b>java.io.InputStream</b>,
<b>java.io.OutputStream</b>,
<b>java.io.Reader</b>,
<b>java.io.Writer</b> and
<b>java.io.RandomAccessFile</b>. I/O resources which are wrapped by other I/O resources
are not reported, as the wrapped resource will be closed by the wrapping resource.

<p>
Use the table below to specify which I/O resources should be ignored by this inspection.
Specify I/O resource classes here which do not need to be closed.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if an I/O resource is allowed to be opened <i>inside</i> a <b>try</b>
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource <i>in front of</i> a <b>try</b>
block.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if an I/O resource is passed as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the resource is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <b>finally</b> block with <i>close</i> in the name and an I/O resource argument will not be ignored.
