Reports any I/O resource which is not safely closed in the <b>finally</b> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed. I/O resources checked
by this inspection include <b>java.io.InputStream</b>,
<b>java.io.OutputStream</b>,
<b>java.io.Reader</b>,
<b>java.io.Writer</b> and
<b>java.io.RandomAccessFile</b>. I/O resources which are wrapped by other I/O resources
are not reported, as the wrapped resource will be closed by the wrapping resource.

<p>
Use the table below to specify which I/O resources should be ignored by this inspection.
Specify I/O resource classes here which do not need to be closed.
Use the checkbox below to specify if a I/O resource is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a try
block.
