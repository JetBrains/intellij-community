Reports cases when <b>==</b> or <b>!=</b> is applied to a newly allocated object
instead of an <b>equals()</b> call. Newly allocated objects cannot be equal to other objects,
thus the compared objects are always unequal. The inspection also may detect 
newly created objects returned from simple methods.
