This global inspection reports packages whose names are either too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern. Since this inspection requires global code analysis, it is only available in batch inspection mode.
<p>
Use the fields provided below to specify minimum length, maximum length and regular expression expected for method parameter names
(Regular expressions are in standard <b>java.util.regex</b> format).
