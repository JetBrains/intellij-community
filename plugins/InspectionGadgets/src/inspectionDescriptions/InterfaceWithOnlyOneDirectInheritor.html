This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports interfaces which have precisely one
direct inheritor. While such interfaces may offer admirable clarity of design,
in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments,
they needlessly increase the total footprint of the application. Consider
merging the interface with its inheritor.
