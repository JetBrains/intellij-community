Reports exceptions constructed and thrown
from inside <code>catch</code> blocks, which do not "wrap" the caught
exception. It is considered good practice when throwing an exception in response to an exception
to wrap the initial exception, so that valuable context information
such as stack frames and line numbers are not lost.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  ...
  catch (IOException e) {
    closeAllConnections();
    throw new ConnectException("Connection problem."); // warning: 'throw' inside 'catch' block ignores the caught exception 'e'
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to indicate if the inspection should ignore exceptions which
receive the result of a method call on the original exception, such as <code>getMessage()</code>,
as an argument.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to have this inspection ignore <code>throw</code> statements which throw exceptions which do not have a
constructor which accepts a <code>Throwable</code> cause.
