Reports on any call to <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition.await()</code> not made inside a loop.
<code>await()</code> and related methods are normally used to suspend a thread until some condition is true.
Because the thread could have been waken up for a different reason,
the condition should be checked after the <code>await()</code> call returns.
A loop is a simple way to achieve this.
<p>Example:</p><pre>
<code>void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException { 
  released.await();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Good code should look like this:
<pre><code>void acquire(Condition released) throws InterruptedException {
  while (acquired) {
    released.await();
  }
}</code></pre>
