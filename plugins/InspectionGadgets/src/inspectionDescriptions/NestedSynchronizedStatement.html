Reports nested <code>synchronized</code> statements.
When possible, it's better to avoid nested synchronization, since in some cases it may lead to a deadlock.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  synchronized (lockA){
    //thread 1 is waiting for lockB
    synchronized (lockB){ //warning
    }
  }
  ...
  synchronized (lockB) {
    //thread 2 is waiting for lockA
    synchronized (lockA) { //warning
    }
  }
</pre>
