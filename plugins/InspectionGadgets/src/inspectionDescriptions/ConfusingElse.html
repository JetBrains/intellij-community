Reports confusing <b>else</b> branches. <b>else</b> branches are confusing
when the <b>if</b> statement is followed by other statements and the <b>if</b> branch
cannot complete normally, for example because it ends with a <b>return</b> statement. In these
cases the statements in the <b>else</b> can be moved after the <b>if</b> statement and
the <b>else</b> branch removed.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to also report <b>else</b> branches of <b>if</b> statements whose
<b>if</b> branch cannot complete normally and which are not followed by more statements,
similar to the Redundant Else intention.
