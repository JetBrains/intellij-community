Reports methods taking a variable number of arguments, also known as varargs methods.
Such methods are not supported under Java 1.4 or earlier JVMs.
The quickfix of this inspection replaces a variable argument
parameter with the equivalent array parameter. Relevant arguments in calls to
the method are wrapped in an array initializer expression.
