Reports any inner classes which may safely be made <b>static</b>.
An inner class may be <b>static</b> if it doesn't reference its enclosing instance.
<p>
A <b>static</b> inner class does not keep an implicit reference to its enclosing instance.
This prevents a common cause of memory leaks and uses less memory per instance of the class.
