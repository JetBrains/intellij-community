Reports any packages which contain too many classes. Overly large packages may
indicate a lack of design clarity.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
