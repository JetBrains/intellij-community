Reports any concrete or abstract classes
which may be simplified to be interfaces. This occurs if the class has no superclass (other
than Object), has no fields declared that are not <b>static</b>, <b>final</b>, and <b>public</b>, and has no
methods declared that are not <b>public</b> and <b>abstract</b>, and no inner classes
that cannot themselves be interfaces.
