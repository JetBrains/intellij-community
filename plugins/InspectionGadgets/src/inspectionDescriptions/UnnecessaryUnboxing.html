Reports "unboxing", e.g. explicit unwrapping of wrapped primitive values.
Unboxing is unnecessary under Java 5 and newer, and can be safely removed.
<p>
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to only report truly superfluous unboxing, where an unboxed value will immediately be implicitly or explicitly boxed.
In this case the entire unboxing-boxing step can be removed. Simple explicit unboxing will not be reported.
