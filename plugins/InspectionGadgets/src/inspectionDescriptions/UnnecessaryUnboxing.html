Reports "unboxing", e.g. explicit unwrapping of wrapped primitive values.
Unboxing is unnecessary under Java 5 and newer, and can be safely removed.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to only report truly superfluous unboxing, where an unboxed value will immediately be implicitly or explicitly boxed.
In this case the entire unboxing-boxing step can be removed. Simple explicit unboxing will not be reported.
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 5 or higher</p>
