Checks lambda's, local and anonymous classes and reports references to local variables outside the class or lambda that are not
<b>Serializable</b>.
When a local variable is referenced from an anonymous class, it's value is stored in an implicit field in the anonymous class.
The same happens for local classes and lambda's.
If that variable is of a non-Serializable type, serialization will fail.
