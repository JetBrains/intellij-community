Reports any implementations of <b>Iterator.hasNext()</b> or <b>ListIterator.hasPrevious()</b>
that call <b>Iterator.next()</b> or <b>ListIterator.previous()</b> on themselves. 
Such calls are almost certainly in error, as methods like <b>hasNext()</b>
should not modify the iterators state, while <b>next()</b> should.
