This inspection reports pointless bitwise
expressions. Such expressions include <b>and</b>ing with zero, <b>or</b>ing by zero,
and shift by zero. Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
