Reports pointless bitwise expressions.
<p>
  Such expressions include applying the <code>&</code> operator to the maximum value for the given type, applying the
  <code>or</code> operator to zero, and shifting by zero. Such expressions may be the result of automated
  refactorings not followed through to completion and are unlikely to be originally intended.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  // Warning: operation is pointless and can be replaced with just `flags`
  // 0xFFFF_FFFF is the maximum value for an integer, and both literals are treated
  // as 32 bit integer literals.
  int bits = flags & 0xFFFF_FFFF;

  // Warning: operation is pointless and can be replaced with just `bits`
  // OR-ing with 0 always outputs the other operand.
  int or = bits | 0x0;

  // Warning: operation is pointless, as always results in 0
  int xor = or ^ or;
