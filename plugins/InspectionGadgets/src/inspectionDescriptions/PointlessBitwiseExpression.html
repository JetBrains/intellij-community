Reports pointless bitwise
expressions. Such expressions include <code>and</code>ing with the maximum value for the given type,
<code>or</code>ing by zero, and shifting by zero. Such expressions may be the result of automated
refactorings not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what
the developer intended to do.
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
  // Warning: operation is pointless and can be replaced with just `flags`
  // 0xFFFF_FFFF is the maximum value for an integer, and both literals are treated
  // as 32 bit integer literals.
  int bits = flags & 0xFFFF_FFFF;

  // Warning: operation is pointless and can be replaced with just `bits`
  // OR-ing with 0 always outputs the other oprand.
  int or = bits | 0x0;

  // Warning: operation is pointless, as always results in 0
  int xor = or ^ or;
