Reports any <b>while</b>,
<b>do-while</b> and <b>for</b>
loops which have the constant <b>true</b> as their
only condition, but which still can be terminated by a containing
<b>if</b> statement which can break out of the loop.
This <b>if</b> statement must be the first or only statement
in a <b>while</b> or <b>for</b>
loops and the last or only statement in a <b>do-while</b> loop.
Such a loop would be clearer if the if statement was removed and its condition
was made an explicit loop condition.
