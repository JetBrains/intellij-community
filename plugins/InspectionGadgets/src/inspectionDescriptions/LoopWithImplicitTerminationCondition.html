Reports any <code>while</code>,
<code>do-while</code>, and <code>for</code>
loops that have the <code>true</code> constant as their
only condition. At the same time, such loops can be still terminated by a containing
<code>if</code> statement which can break out of the loop.
<p>Such an <code>if</code> statement must be the first or the only statement
in a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code>
loop and the last or the only statement in a <code>do-while</code> loop.</p>

<p>Removing the <code>if</code> statement and making its condition an explicit
  loop condition simplifies the loop.</p>
