Reports <b>AutoCloseable</b> instances which are not used in a try-with-resources statement, also known as
<i>Automatic Resource Management</i>.
This means that the open resource before/in <b>try</b>, close in <b>finally</b> style which was used before
try-with-resources was available is also reported.
This inspection is meant to replace all <i>opened but not safely closed</i> inspections when developing in Java 7 and higher.
<p>
Use the first table below to specify which AutoCloseable subclasses should be ignored by this inspection.
Specify AutoCloseable subclasses here which do not need to be closed.
<p>
Use the second table below to specify which methods returning AutoCloseable will be ignored when called.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore an AutoCloseable if it the result of a method call.
When enabled, the results of factory methods will also be ignored.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if an AutoCloseable instance is passed
as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the resource is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <b>finally</b> block with <i>close</i> in the name and an AutoCloseable argument will not be ignored.
