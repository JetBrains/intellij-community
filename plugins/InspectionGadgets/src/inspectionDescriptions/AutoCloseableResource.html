Reports <code>AutoCloseable</code> instances which are not used in a try-with-resources statement, also known as
<i>Automatic Resource Management</i>.
This means that the open resource before/in <code>try</code>, close in <code>finally</code> style which was used before
try-with-resources was available is also reported.
This inspection is meant to replace all <i>opened but not safely closed</i> inspections when developing in Java 7 and higher.
<p>Example: </p>
<pre>
  private static void foo() throws IOException {
    InputStream profile = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("/someFile");
    System.out.println(profile.read());
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first table below to specify which <code>AutoCloseable</code> subclasses should be ignored by this inspection.
Specify <code>AutoCloseable</code> subclasses here which do not need to be closed.
<p>
  <b>Note</b>: This inspection will still warn on streams returned from the <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> methods <code>lines()</code>,
  <code>walk()</code>, <code>list()</code> and <code>find()</code>,
  even when <code>java.util.stream.Stream</code> is specified to be ignored in this table.
  These streams contain an associated I/O resource that needs to be closed.
</p>
<p>
Use the second table below to specify which methods returning <code>AutoCloseable</code> will be ignored when called.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore an <code>AutoCloseable</code> if it the result of a method call.
When enabled, the results of factory methods will also be ignored.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if an <code>AutoCloseable</code> instance is passed
as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the resource is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <code>finally</code> block with <code>close</code> in the name and an <code>AutoCloseable</code> argument will not be ignored.
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to ignore method references to constructors of resource classes.
<p>
Use the fourth checkbox below to ignore methods that return resource and has a name that starts with 'get'.
  This may be useful because most of the getters do not transmit the ownership of resource and use sites are not responsible for closing resource.
