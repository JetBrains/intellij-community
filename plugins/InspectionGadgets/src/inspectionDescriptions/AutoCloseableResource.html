Reports <b>AutoCloseable</b> instances which are not used in a <b>try</b>-with-resources statement, also known as <i>Automatic Resource Management</i>.
This means that the open resource before/in <b>try</b>, close in <b>finally</b> style which was used before <b>try</b>-with-resources was available is also reported.
This inspection is meant to replace all <i>opened but not safely closed</i> inspections when developing in Java 7.
