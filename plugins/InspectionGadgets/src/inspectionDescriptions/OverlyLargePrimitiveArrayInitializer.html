This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports array initializer expressions for primitive
arrays which contain too many elements. Such initializers may result in overly large
class files, as code must be generated to initialize each array element. In memory
or bandwidth constrained environments, it may be more efficient to load large arrays
of primitives from resource files.

Use the field below to specify the maximum number of elements to allow in
primitive array initializers.
