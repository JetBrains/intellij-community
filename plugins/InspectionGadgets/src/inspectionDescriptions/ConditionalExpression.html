Reports the ternary condition operator. Some coding standards prohibit the use of
the condition operator, in favor of <b>if-else</b> statements.

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore simple assignments and returns and thus allow constructs like this:
<pre>
    String s = (foo == null) ? "" : foo.toString();
</pre>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore conditional expression in contexts where an if statement is not allowed.
For example when the conditional expression is used as an argument to a <b>super()</b> constructor call, or inside a field initializer.
