Reports methods that are named "main", but do not have the
<code>public static void main(String[])</code> signature.
<p>Such methods may be confusing, as methods named "main"
  are expected to be application entry points.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Main {
    void main(String[] args) {} //a warning here because there are no "public static" modifiers
  }
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such methods is available only in the editor.</p>
