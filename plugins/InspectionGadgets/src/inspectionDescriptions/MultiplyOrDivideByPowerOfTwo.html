Reports multiplication of an integer value by a constant power of 2. These
expressions may be replaced by right or left shift operations, 
for a possible performance improvement.
<p>
  Please note that this inspection is unnecessary for modern JVMs (e. g., 
  HotSpot or OpenJ9), as their JIT compilers perform the same optimization automatically. 
  It might only be useful in some embedded systems where no JIT compilation is performed.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  int y = x * 4;
</code></pre>
A quick-fix is suggested to replace the multiplication or division operation with shift:
<pre><code>
  int y = x &lt;&lt; 2;
</code></pre>

  Use the checkbox below to enable the inspection for divisions by a power of two. Note that replacing
  a power of two division by a shift does not work for negative numbers.
