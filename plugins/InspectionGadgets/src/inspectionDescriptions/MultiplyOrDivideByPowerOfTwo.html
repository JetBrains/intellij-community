This inspection reports multiplication of an integer value by a constant power of 2. These
expressions may be replaced by right or left shift operations, to some possible performance improvement.

Use the check box below to enable the inspection for divisions by a power of two also. Note that replacing
a power of two division by a shift does not work for negative numbers.
