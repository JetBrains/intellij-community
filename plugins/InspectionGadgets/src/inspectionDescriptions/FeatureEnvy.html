Reports the "Feature Envy" code smell. Feature
envy is defined as occurring when a method calls methods on another class three
or more times. Calls to library classes, parent classes, contained or containing
classes are not counted for purposes of this inspection. Feature
envy is often an indication that functionality is located in the wrong class.
