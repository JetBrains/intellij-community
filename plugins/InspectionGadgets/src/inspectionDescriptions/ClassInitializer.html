This inspection reports any of non-<b>static</b> initializers
in classes. Some coding standards prohibit such initializers, preferring initialization to be done
in constructors or field initializers. Non-<b>static</b> initializers
may also be inadvertently created by deleting the <b>static</b> keyword,
resulting in obscure bugs.
