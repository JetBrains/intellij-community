Reports any <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock</code> resource which is not acquired in front of a
<code>try</code> block or not unlocked in the corresponding <code>finally</code> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  lock.lock(); // will be reported since finally block is missing
  try {
    doSmthWithLock();
  } catch (IOException e) {
    throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
  }
  lock.unlock();
</pre>
