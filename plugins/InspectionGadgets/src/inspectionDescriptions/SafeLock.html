Reports <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock</code> resources that are not acquired in front of a
<code>try</code> block or not unlocked in the corresponding <code>finally</code> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  lock.lock(); // will be reported since the 'finally' block is missing
  try {
    doSmthWithLock();
  } catch (IOException e) {
    throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
  }
  lock.unlock();
</code></pre>
