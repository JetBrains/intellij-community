Reports any cases where a <b>java.util.Collection</b>
or <b>java.util.Map</b> is added as an element of itself. While Bertrand Russell
might approve of such a construct, the JVM will likely not, throwing a <b>java.lang.StackOverflowError</b>
if <b>hashCode()</b> is ever called on the self-containing collection.
