This inspection reports <b>try</b> statements with multiple resources.
<p>The quick fix suggests to split such statements into nested <b>try-with-resources</b> statements.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Example of <b>try</b> statement with multiple resources:
<pre><code>try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("in.txt");
     FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("out.txt")) {
  /*read and write*/
}</code></pre>
<p>The example above is transformed into the following:
<pre><code>try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("in.txt")) {
  try (FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("out.txt")) {
    /*read and write*/
  }
}</code></pre>
