Reports <code>assert</code> statement conditions which are constants. <code>assert</code>
statements with constant conditions will either always fail or always succeed.
Such statements can easily be left over after refactoring and are probably a bug.
<p>Example: </p>
<pre>
    void foo() {
        assert true;
    }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
