Reports type casts which are overly strong. For instance,
casting an object to <b>ArrayList</b> when casting it to
<b>List</b> would do just as well. <b>Note:</b> much like the <i>Redundant type cast</i>
inspection, applying the fix for this inspection may change the semantics of your program, if you are
intentionally using an overly strong cast to cause a <b>ClassCastException</b> to be generated. Use caution.
