This global inspection reports any modules which contain too few classes. Overly small modules may
indicate an overly fragmented design.
Since this inspection requires global code analysis, it is only available in batch inspection mode.
<p>
Use the field below to specify the minimum number of classes a module may have before triggering this inspection.
