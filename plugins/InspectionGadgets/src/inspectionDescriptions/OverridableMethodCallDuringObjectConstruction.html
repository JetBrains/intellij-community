Reports any calls to overridable methods of the current class during object construction.
A call is during object construction if it is made inside a constructor, in an non-static instance initializer,
in a non-static field initializer or inside a <b>clone()</b>, <b>readObject()</b> or <b>readObjectNoData()</b> method.
Methods are overridable if they are not declared <b>final</b>, <b>static</b> or <b>private</b>.
Package local methods are considered safe, even though they are overridable.
Such calls may result in subtle bugs, as the object is not guaranteed to be initialized
before the method call occurs.

<p>
The inspections <i>Overridable method called during object construction</i>,
<i>Overridden method called during object construction</i> and
<i>Abstract method called during object construction</i> report overlapping problem sets and only one should be enabled at a time
to prevent duplicate warnings.
