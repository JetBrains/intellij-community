This inspection reports any calls of overridable methods of the current class during object construction.
An object is constructed inside a constructor, an instance initializer or
inside a <b>clone()</b>, <b>readObject()</b> or <b>readObjectNoData()</b> method.
Methods are overridable if they are not declared <b>final</b>,
<b>static</b> or <b>private</b>.
Such calls may result in subtle bugs, as the object is not guaranteed to be initialized
before the method call occurs.
