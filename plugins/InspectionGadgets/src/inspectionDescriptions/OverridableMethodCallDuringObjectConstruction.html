Reports calls to overridable methods of the current class during object construction.
<p>A method is called during object construction if it is inside a:
<ul>
  <li>Constructor</li>
  <li>Non-static instance initializer</li>
  <li>Non-static field initializer</li>
  <li><code>clone()</code> method</li>
  <li><code>readObject()</code> method</li>
  <li><code>readObjectNoData()</code> method</li>
<p>Methods are overridable if they are not declared as <code>final</code>, <code>static</code>, or <code>private</code>.
  Package-local methods are considered safe, even though they are overridable. Such calls may result in subtle bugs,
  as object initialization may happen before the method call.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Parent {
    void someMethod() { }
  }

  class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
      someMethod();
    }
  }
</code></pre>

  <p>This inspection shares the functionality with the following inspections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abstract method called during object construction</li>
  <li>Overridden method called during object construction</li>
</ul>
  <p>Only one inspection should be enabled at once to prevent warning duplication.</p>
