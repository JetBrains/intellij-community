Reports possible escapes of <b>this</b>
during object construction. Escapes occur when <b>this</b>
is used as a method argument or the object of an assignment in a constructor or
initializer. Such escapes may result in subtle bugs, as the object is now
available in a context in which it is not guaranteed to be initialized.
