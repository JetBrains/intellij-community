This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports fields which are accessed three or more times by a given method,
or which are accessed in a loop. While such field access may be logically correct, it is often more performant
to replace such accesses with local variables, copying the fields to a temporary local and copying back if necessary.
  <!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore <b>final</b> fields being repeatedly accessed, as many compilers and JVMs
can optimize that case without explicit creation of a temporary local variable. Constant fields are always ignored by this inspection.
