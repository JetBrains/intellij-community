Reports unnecessary constructors.
A constructor is unnecessary if it is the only constructor of a class, has no parameters,
has the same access modifiers as its containing class,
and does not perform any initialization except explicitly or implicitly calling the super class constructor without arguments.
Such a constructor can be safely removed as it will be generated by the compiler even if not specified.
