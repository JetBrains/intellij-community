Reports any variables and parameters which are used in a loop condition
and are not updated inside the loop. These may cause an infinite loop if executed and
are probably not what was intended.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  void loopDoesNotLoop(boolean b) {
    while (b) {
      System.out.println();
      break;
    }
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the checkbox below to disable this inspection if condition can be updated indirectly (e.g. via called method
  or concurrently from another thread).
