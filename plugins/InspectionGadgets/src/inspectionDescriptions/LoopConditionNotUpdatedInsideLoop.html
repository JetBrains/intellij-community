Reports any variables and parameters which are used in a loop condition
and are not updated inside the loop. These may cause an infinite loop if executed and
are probably not what was intended.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  The option "Ignore possible non-local changes" suppresses warnings if condition can be updated indirectly (via called method
  or concurrently from another thread).
