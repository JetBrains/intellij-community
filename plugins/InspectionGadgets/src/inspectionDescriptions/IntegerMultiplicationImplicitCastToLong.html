Reports integer multiplications or left shifts which are implicitly cast to long.
For example:
<pre><code>
  <b>void</b> x(int i) {
    <b>long</b> val = 65536 * i;
  }
</code></pre>
Such multiplication is often a mistake, as overflow truncation may occur unexpectedly.
Converting the <b>int</b> literal to a <b>long</b> literal (<code>65536L</code>) fixes the problem.
