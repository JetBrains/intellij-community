Reports <b>clone()</b> methods which
are not declared <b>final</b>. Since <b>clone()</b> may
be used to instantiate objects without using a constructor, allowing the <b>clone()</b>
method to be overridden may result in corrupted objects, and possible security
exploits. This may be prevented by making the <b>clone()</b>
method <b>final</b>.
