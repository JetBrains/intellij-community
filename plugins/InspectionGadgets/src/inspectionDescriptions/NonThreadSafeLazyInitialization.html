Reports <b>static</b> variables being lazily initialized
in a non-thread-safe manner. Lazy initialization of <b>static</b> variables should be done
in an appropriate synchronization construct, to prevent different threads from
performing conflicting initialization.
<p>
If applicable, a quickfix is suggested
which introduces the static holder pattern described in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_on_demand_holder_idiom">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_on_demand_holder_idiom
</a>
where the JVM guarantees the thread safety of such initializations.
