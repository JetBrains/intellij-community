Reports JUnit 4 <b>@Test</b> annotated methods which are located inside a class
extending the abstract JUnit 3 class <b>TestCase</b>. Mixing JUnit API's like this is
confusing and can lead to problems running the tests, for example a method annotated with <b>@Ignore</b> won't
be actually ignored if its name starts with test.
