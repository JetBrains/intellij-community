Reports any uses of variables which are known to be constant. This
is the case if the (read) use of the variable is surrounded by an
<b>if</b>, <b>while</b> or <b>for</b>
statement with an <b>==</b> condition which compares the variable with a constant. In such
a case the use
of a variable which is known to be constant can be replaced with the actual constant.
