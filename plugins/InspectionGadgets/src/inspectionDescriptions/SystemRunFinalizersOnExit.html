Reports calls to <code>System.runFinalizersOnExit()</code>.
<p>
  This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language. It is inherently non-thread-safe,
  may result in data corruption, a deadlock, and may affect parts of the program far removed from its call point.
  It is deprecated and was removed in JDK 11, and its use is strongly discouraged.
</p>
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 10 or lower.</p>
