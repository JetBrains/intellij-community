Reports any calls to <code>System.runFinalizersOnExit()</code>.
This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language. It is inherently non-thread-safe,
may result in data corruption, deadlock, and may affect parts of the program far removed from its call point.
It is deprecated and was removed in JDK 11, and its use is strongly discouraged.
