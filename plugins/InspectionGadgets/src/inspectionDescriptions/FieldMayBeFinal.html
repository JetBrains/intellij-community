Reports any fields that can be safely made <code>final</code>.
<p>Using the <code>final</code> variable makes code more error-prone. It may also be helpful for compiler optimisations
  that make your program run faster.</p>
<p>A field may be safely made <code>final</code> only if it has the <code>private</code> access modifier
  (or it is defined in a local / anonymous class) and:<p>
<ul>
  <li>It is <code>static</code> and initialized either in its declaration or in one static class initializer.</li>
  <li>It is non-static and initialized either in its declaration or in one non-static class initializer or in all constructors.</li>
</ul>
