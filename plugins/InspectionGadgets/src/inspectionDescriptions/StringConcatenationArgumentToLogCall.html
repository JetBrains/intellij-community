Reports non-constant string concatenations used as arguments to SLF4J and Log4j 2 logging methods.
Non-constant concatenations will be evaluated at runtime even when the logging message is not logged; this can negatively impact performance.
It is recommended to use a parameterized log message instead, which will not be evaluated when logging is disabled.
