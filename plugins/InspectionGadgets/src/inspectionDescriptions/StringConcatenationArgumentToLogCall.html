Reports non-constant string concatenations used as arguments to SLF4J logging methods.
Non-constant concatenations will be evaluated at runtime even when the logging message is not logged; this can negatively impact performance.
It is recommended to use a parameterized log message instead, which will not be evaluated when logging is disabled.

Use the combobox below to ignore certain logging levels (where <i>error</i> is the highest level and <i>trace</i> is the lowest level).
