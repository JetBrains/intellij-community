Reports usages of package-private members declared in the same package but in a different module.
<p>If the declaring classes are loaded by different loaders, the code that accesses a package-private member will fail with
  <code>IllegalAccessError</code> at runtime.</p>
<p>If a method overrides a package-private method from a class that is loaded by a different loader, it won't be invoked when the super
  method is called on an instance of the implementing class.</p>
<p>If a method implements an abstract package-private method from a class that is loaded by a different loader,
  calling the super method on an instance of the implementing class will fail with <code>AbstractMethodError</code>.</p>
