Reports calls to object constructors inside <b>clone()</b> methods.
Instantiation of objects inside of <b>clone()</b> should be done by calling <b>clone()</b>,
instead of creating the object directly, to support later subclassing.
This inspection will not report
<b>clone()</b> methods declared <b>final</b>,
or <b>clone()</b> methods on <b>final</b> classes.
