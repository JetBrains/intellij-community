Reports any <code>import</code> statements which cover entire packages ('* imports').
<p>Some coding standards prohibit such <code>import</code> statements.</p>
<p>
  You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to detect and fix such statements with its "Optimize Imports"
  command. To do this, go to
  <a href="settings://preferences.sourceCode.Java?Use%20single%20class%20import">Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Imports</a>,
  make sure that the "Use single class import" option is enabled and specify values in the
  "Class count to use import with '*'" and "Names count to use static import with '*'" fields.
  Thus this inspection is mostly useful for off-line reporting on code bases that you don't
  intend to change.
