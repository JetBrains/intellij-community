Reports any calls of <b>abstract</b> methods of the current class during object construction.
A call is during object construction if it is made inside a constructor, in an non-static instance initializer,
in a non-static field initializer or inside a <b>clone()</b>, <b>readObject()</b> or <b>readObjectNoData()</b> method.
Such calls may result in subtle bugs, as the object is not guaranteed to be initialized
before the method call occurs.

<p>
The inspections <i>Overridable method called during object construction</i>,
<i>Overridden method called during object construction</i> and
<i>Abstract method called during object construction</i> report overlapping problem sets and only one should be enabled at a time
to prevent duplicate warnings.
