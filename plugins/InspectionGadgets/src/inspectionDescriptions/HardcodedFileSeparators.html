Reports the forward (<code>/</code>) or backward (<code>\</code>) slash in a string or
character literal. These characters are commonly used as file separators, and portability may suffer if their use is hardcoded.
This will not report backward slash inside escape sequences, or forward slash immediately following a '&lt;' character,
or immediately preceding a '&gt;' character, as those often indicate XML or HTML tags rather than file names,
strings representing a <code>java.util.TimeZone</code> ID, strings that are a valid regular expression
or strings that equal an IANA-registered MIME media type.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  new File("C:\\Users\\Name");
</code></pre>

<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to include <code>example/*</code> in the set of recognized media types.
  Normally, usage of the <code>example/*</code> MIME media type outside of an example (e.g. in a <code>Content-Type</code>
  header) is an error.
