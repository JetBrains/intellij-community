Reports the forward (<code>/</code>) or backward (<code>\</code>) slash in a string or
character literal. These characters are commonly used as file separators, and portability may suffer if they are hardcoded.
<p>
  The inspection will not report backward slashes inside escape sequences and forward slashes immediately following the '&lt;' character
  or immediately preceding the '&gt;' character, as those often indicate XML or HTML tags rather than file names.
  Strings representing a <code>java.util.TimeZone</code> ID, strings that are valid regular expressions,
  or strings that equal IANA-registered MIME media types will not be reported either.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  new File("C:\\Users\\Name");
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the option to include <code>example/*</code> in the set of recognized media types.
  Normally, usage of the <code>example/*</code> MIME media type outside of an example (e.g. in a <code>Content-Type</code>
  header) is an error.
