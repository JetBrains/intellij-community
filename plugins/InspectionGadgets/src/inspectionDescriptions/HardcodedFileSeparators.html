Reports the forward (/) or backward (\) slash in a string or
character literal. These characters are commonly used as file separators, and portability may suffer if their use is hardcoded.
This will not report a forward slash immediately following a '&lt;' character,
or immediately preceding a '&gt;' character, as those often indicate XML or HTML tags rather than file names,
strings representing a <b>java.util.TimeZone</b> ID, strings that are a valid regular expression or strings that equal an IANA-registered MIME media type.
<p>
Normally, usage of the <b>example/*</b> MIME media type outside of an example (<em>e.g.</em> in a <b>Content-Type</b>
header) is an error.

Use the checkbox below to include <b>example/*</b> in the set of recognized media types.
