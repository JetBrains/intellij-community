This inspection reports the assignment of a variable to
<b>null</b>, outside of declarations.
While occasionally useful for triggering garbage collection, this
construct may make the code more prone
to NullPointerExceptions, and often indicates that the developer doesn't
really understand the class's intended semantics.
