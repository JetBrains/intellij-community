Reports instantiations of <code>Throwable</code> or a subclass, where the created <code>Throwable</code>
is never actually thrown.
These are simple mistakes to make which are hard to catch in tests.
<p>Also reports method calls which return instances of <code>Throwable</code> or a subclass,
where the result of the method call is not thrown.
Calls to methods annotated with Error Prone's or AssertJ's <code>@CanIgnoreReturnValue</code> annotation will not be reported.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
    void leftBehind() throws Throwable {
        RuntimeException e = new RuntimeException("throw me");
        // ...
    }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
