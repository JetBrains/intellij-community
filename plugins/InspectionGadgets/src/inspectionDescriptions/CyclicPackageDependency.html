Reports any packages which are mutually or cyclically dependent
on other packages. Such cyclic dependencies make for fragile code and high maintenance costs.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
