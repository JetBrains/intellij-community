Reports any attempt to return a <b>java.lang.Date</b> or
<b>java.lang.Calendar</b> field from a method. Since
<b>Date</b> or <b>Calendar</b> are often
treated as immutable values but are actually mutable, this construct may
result in an object having its state modified unexpectedly. While occasionally useful for performance
reasons, this construct is inherently bug-prone.
