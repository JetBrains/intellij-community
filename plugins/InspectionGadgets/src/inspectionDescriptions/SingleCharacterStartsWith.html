Reports any calls to <code>String.startsWith()</code> or
<code>String.endsWith()</code> where single character string literals passed as a parameter.
<p>There is a fix that replaces such calls with more efficiently implemented <code>String.charAt()</code>.</p>
Because the performance gain is minimal and the code becomes less readable because of the extra non-zero length check,
it is recommended to do so only inside tight loops.

  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  boolean startsWithX(String s) {
    return s.startsWith("x");
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre>
  boolean startsWithX(String s) {
    return !s.isEmpty() && s.charAt(0) == 'x';
  }
</pre>
