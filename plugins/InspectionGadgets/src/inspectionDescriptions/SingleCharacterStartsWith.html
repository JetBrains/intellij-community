This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports any calls to <b>String.startsWith()</b> or
<b>String.endsWith()</b> which are passed single character string
literals as parameter. Such calls may be more efficiently implemented with
<b>String.charAt()</b>. Because the performance gain is
minimal, the needed extra check for non-zero length, and the negative effect on
code clarity, it is recommended to do so only inside tight loops.
