This inspection reports any instantiations of <b>java.util.Map</b> objects
whose key types are enumerated classes. Such <b>java.util.Map</b> objects
can be replaced by <b>java.util.EnumMap</b> objects.
<b>java.util.EnumMap</b> implementations can be much more efficient
that those of other sets, as the underlying data structure is a simple array.
