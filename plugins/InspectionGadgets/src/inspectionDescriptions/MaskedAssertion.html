Reports assert statements and test framework assertions that are masked via catch blocks.
Such assertions will never fail, as the thrown AssertionError will be caught and silently ignored.
Examples:<br>
<code><pre>
void javaAssertion() {
  try {
    ...
    assert 1 == 2; // the assertion is silently ignored
  } catch (AssertionError e) {}
}
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
@Test
void testWithAssertJ() {
  try {
    ...
    assertThat(1).as("test").isEqualTo(2); // the assertion is silently ignored
  } catch (AssertionError e) {}
}
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
@Test
void testWithJunit() {
  try {
    ...
    assertEquals(1, 2); // the assertion is silently ignored
  } catch (AssertionError e) {}
}
</pre></code>
