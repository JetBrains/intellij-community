Reports any non-atomic operations on <code>volatile</code> fields. Non-atomic
operations on <code>volatile</code> fields are operations where the field is read and
the value is used to update the field. It is possible for the value of the
field to change between the read and the write, possibly invalidating the operation.
The non-atomic operation can be avoided by surrounding it with a <code>synchronized</code> block or
by making use of one of the classes from the <code>java.util.concurrent.atomic</code> package.
