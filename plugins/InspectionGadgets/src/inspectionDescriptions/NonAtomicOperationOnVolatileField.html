Reports any non-atomic operations on volatile fields. Non-atomic
operations on volatile fields are operations where the volatile field is read and
the value is used to update the volatile field. It is possible for the value of the
field to change between the read and write, making the operation possibly invalid.
In such cases it is better to surround the operation with a synchronized block or
make use of one of the <b>Atomic*</b> or
<b>Atomic*FieldUpdater</b> classes
from the <b>java.util.concurrent.atomic</b> package.
