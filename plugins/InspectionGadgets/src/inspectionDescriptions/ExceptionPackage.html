Reports a package only with classes that extend <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, either directly or indirectly.
  <p>Although exceptions usually don't depend on other classes for their implementation, they are normally not used separately.
    It is often a better design to locate exceptions in the same package as the classes that use them.</p>
