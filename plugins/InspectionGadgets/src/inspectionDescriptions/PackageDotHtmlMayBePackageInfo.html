This inspection reports any package.html files. These files are used for documenting
packages. Since J2SE 5 it is recommended to use package-info.java files instead, since such
files can also contain package annotations.  In this way, package-info.java becomes the
sole repository for package level annotations and documentation.
<p>
This inspection provides a quickfix to convert the package.html file to a package-info.java file.
If a package-info.java file is already present this inspection provides a quickfix to delete
the package.html file, since the Javadoc tool would ignore it then anyway.
