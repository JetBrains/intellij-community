This inspection reports abstract JUnit test classes whose names are either too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern. For clarity and ease of tooling, it is a common coding
standard that abstract JUnit test classes follow a specific pattern, usually requiring that the class name end
with "TestCase".
