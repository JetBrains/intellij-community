This global inspection reports any classes on which too many other classes in your project
are directly dependent. Such classes may be expensive to modify, as changes to the class may
require changing many other classes. Only top-level classes are reported by this inspection.
Since this inspection requires global code analysis, it is only available in batch inspection mode.
