Reports any classes on which too many other classes
are directly dependent. Such classes may be expensive to modify, as changes to the class may
require changing many other classes. Only top-level classes are reported by this inspection.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
