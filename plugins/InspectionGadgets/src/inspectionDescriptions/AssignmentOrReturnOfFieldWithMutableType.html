Reports any attempt to return or assign an array, <b>Collection</b>, <b>java.lang.Date</b> or
<b>java.lang.Calendar</b> field from a method parameter.
Since arrays, <b>Collection</b>, <b>Date</b> and <b>Calendar</b> are mutable, this construct may
result in an object having its state modified unexpectedly from outside the owning class.
While occasionally useful for performance reasons, this construct is inherently bug prone.
