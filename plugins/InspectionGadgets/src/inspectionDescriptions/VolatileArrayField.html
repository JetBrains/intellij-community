Reports array fields
which are declared as <b>volatile</b>. Such fields
may be confusing, as accessing the array itself follows the rules for <b>volatile</b>
fields, but accessing the array's contents does not. If such volatile access is needed to array contents,
the JDK5.0 <b>java.util.concurrent.atomic</b> classes should be used instead.
