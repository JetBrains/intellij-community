Reports expressions that are affected by autoboxing conversion (automatic wrapping of primitive values as objects).
Try not to use objects instead of primitives. It might significantly affect performance.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>Integer x = 42;</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix makes the conversion explicit:</p>
<pre><code>Integer x = Integer.valueOf(42);</code></pre>

  <i>AutoBoxing</i> appeared in Java 5.
  This inspection can help to downgrade for backward compatibility with earlier Java versions.
