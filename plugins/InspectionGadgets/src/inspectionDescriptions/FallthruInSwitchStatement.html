Reports 'fall-through' in a <b>switch</b> statement.
Fall-through is defined to occur when a series of executable statements after a <b>switch</b> label is not guaranteed
to transfer control before the next <b>switch</b> label. In that case, control falls through to the statements after
that <b>switch</b> label, even though the <b>switch</b> expression does not equal
the value of the fallen-through label. While occasionally intended, this construction is confusing, and is often the result of a typo.
<p>
This inspection ignores any fall-through commented with a text matching the regex pattern <code>(?i)falls?\s*thro?u</code>.
