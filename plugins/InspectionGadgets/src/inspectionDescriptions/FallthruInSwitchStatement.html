Reports 'fallthrough' in a <b>switch</b> statement.
'Fallthrough' is defined to occur when a series of executable statements after a <b>switch</b> label is not guaranteed
to transfer control before the next <b>switch</b> label. In that case, control 'falls through' to the statements after
that <b>switch</b> label, even though the <b>switch</b> expression does not equal
the value of the fallen-through label. While occasionally intended, this construction is confusing, and is often the result of a typo.
