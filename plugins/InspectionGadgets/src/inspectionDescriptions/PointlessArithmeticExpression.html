This inspection reports pointless arithmetic
expressions. Such expressions include adding or subtracting zero, multiplying by zero or one,
division by one, and shift by zero. Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
