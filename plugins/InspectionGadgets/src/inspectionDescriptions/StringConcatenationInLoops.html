This inspection reports String concatenation in loops. For performance reasons, it
is preferable to replace such concatenation with explicit calls to
<b>StringBuilder.append()</b> or
<b>StringBuffer.append()</b>
<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate that this inspection should only warn when the same variable
is appended to inside the loop.
