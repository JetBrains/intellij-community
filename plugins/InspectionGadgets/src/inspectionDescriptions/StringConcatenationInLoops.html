Reports String concatenation in loops. As every String concatenation copies the whole String, usually it is preferable to replace
it with explicit calls to <b>StringBuilder.append()</b> or <b>StringBuffer.append()</b>.

<p>
  Sometimes quick-fix actions are available which allow you to convert <code>String</code> variable to <code>StringBuilder</code> or
  introduce a new <code>StringBuilder</code>. Be careful if the original code handles <code>null</code> value specially: the replacement
  might not be semantically correct after that. Also it's not guaranteed that the automatic replacement will always be more performant.
