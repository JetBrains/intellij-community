<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any calls to JUnit assertEquals() which have
a non-literal as the expected result argument and a literal as the actual result argument.  Such calls
will behave fine for assertions which pass, but may give confusing error reports if their expected and actual
arguments differ.
