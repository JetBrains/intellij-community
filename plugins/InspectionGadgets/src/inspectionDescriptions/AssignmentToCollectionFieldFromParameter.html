Reports any attempt to assign an array or <b>Collection</b> field from a method parameter.
Since the array or <b>Collection</b> may have its contents modified by the calling method, this construct may
result in an object having its state modified unexpectedly. While occasionally useful for performance
reasons, this construct is inherently bug-prone.
