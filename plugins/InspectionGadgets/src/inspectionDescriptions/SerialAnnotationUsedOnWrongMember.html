Reports methods and fields in <b>Serializable</b> and <b>Externalizable</b> classes that are not suitable to be annotated with the <b>java.io.Serial</b> annotation.
<p>
Examples:<br>
<code><pre>
class Test implements Serializable {
  @Serial //The annotated field is not a part of serialization mechanism as it's not final
  private static long serialVersionUID = 7874493593505141603L;

  @Serial //The annotated method is not a part of the serialization mechanism as it's not private
  void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
  }
}
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
class Test implements Externalizable {
  @Serial //The annotated method is not a part of the serialization mechanism as it's inside Externalizable class
  private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
  }
}
</pre></code>
