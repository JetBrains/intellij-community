Reports string literals containing an octal escape sequence immediately followed by
a digit.
<p>Such strings may be confusing, and are often the result of errors in escape code creation.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  System.out.println("\1234"); // Octal escape sequence '\123' immediately followed by a digit
</code></pre>
