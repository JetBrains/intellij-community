Reports <b>clone()</b> methods which are not declared as throwing
<b>CloneNotSupportedException</b>. If <b>clone()</b> is not declared
to possibly throw <b>CloneNotSupportedException</b>, then subclasses which need to
prohibit cloning will not be able to do so in the standard way. This inspection will not report
<b>clone()</b> methods declared <b>final</b>,
or <b>clone()</b> methods on <b>final</b> classes.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate if this inspection should only warn on <b>protected</b> methods.
In <i>Effective Java, Second Edition</i> (but not in the first edition) it is recommended to omit the <b>CloneNotSupportedException</b>
declaration on <b>public</b> methods, because methods that don't throw checked exceptions are easier to use.
