Reports any methods which override methods in a superclass but do not have the
<code>@java.lang.Override</code> annotation.
<p>
  Having annotation is good for readability because it shows intent. Also in this
  case compiler emits error when signature of the overridden method doesn't match
  super class method.

<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection ignore the
    <code>java.lang.Object</code> methods
    <code>equals()</code>,
    <code>hashCode()</code> and
    <code>toString()</code>. The risk that these methods will disappear and thus
    your code won't be compiling anymore due to the <code>@Override</code>
    annotation is vanishingly small.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the second checkbox below to have this inspection ignore overriding methods
    in anonymous classes. It might be useful for you if you want anonymous classes
    to be as short as possible.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 5 or higher</p>
