Reports any methods which override methods in a superclass but
do not have the <b>@java.lang.Override</b> annotation.
<p>
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection ignore the
<b>java.lang.Object</b> methods
<b>equals()</b>,
<b>hashCode()</b> and
<b>toString()</b>. The risk of these methods
going missing and thus your code not compiling anymore due to the
<b>@Override</b> annotation is vanishingly small.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to have this inspection ignore overriding methods
in anonymous classes.
