Reports fields of type <b>java.lang.ThreadLocal</b> which are not declared <b>static final</b>.
In the most common case a <b>java.lang.ThreadLocal</b> instance
associates state with a thread. A non-static non-final
<b>java.lang.ThreadLocal</b> field associates state with
an instance-thread combination. This is seldom necessary and often a bug
which can cause memory leaks and possibly incorrect behavior.
