Reports fields of type <code>java.lang.ThreadLocal</code> which are not declared <code>static final</code>.
In the most common case a <code>java.lang.ThreadLocal</code> instance
associates state with a thread. A non-static non-final
<code>java.lang.ThreadLocal</code> field associates state with
an instance-thread combination. This is usually unnecessary and quite often is a bug
which can cause memory leaks and possibly incorrect behavior.

This inspection has a quick fix to make the field <code>static final</code>

<p>Example: </p>
<pre>
  private ThreadLocal tl = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> Boolean.TRUE);
