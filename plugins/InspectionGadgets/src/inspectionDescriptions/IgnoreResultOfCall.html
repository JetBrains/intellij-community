Reports any calls to specific methods where the result of that call is ignored.
Method calls inspected are:
<ul>
  <li>Calls to simple getters (which do nothing except return a field)</li>
  <li>Calls to methods specified in the settings of this inspection</li>
  <li>Calls to Methods annotated with <b>org.jetbrains.annotations.Contract(pure=true)</b></li>
  <li>Calls to Methods annotated with .*.<b>CheckReturnValue</b></li>
  <li>Calls to Methods located in a class annotated with <b>javax.annotation.CheckReturnValue</b></li>
  <li>Calls to Methods located in a package annotated with <b>javax.annotation.CheckReturnValue</b></li>
  <li>Optionally all calls to non-library methods</li>
</ul>
<p>For calls to many methods ignoring the result is perfectly
legitimate, but for some methods it is almost certainly an error. Examples of methods where ignoring
the result of a call is likely to be an error include <b>java.io.inputStream.read()</b>,
which returns the number of bytes actually read and any method on
<b>java.lang.String </b> or <b>java.math.BigInteger</b>,
as all of those methods are side-effect free and thus pointless if ignored.

<p>
Use the panel below to specify the names of the classes containing the methods and method name patterns of the methods you wish to check.
Class names have to be specified as a fully qualified name string and will match a class and all its inheritors.
Method name patterns use the Java regular expression syntax.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to report all calls to non-library methods where the result of that call is ignored
