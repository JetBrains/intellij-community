Reports any calls to specific methods where the result of that call is ignored.
Both methods specified in the inspection's settings and methods annotated with
<b>org.jetbrains.annotations.Contract(pure=true)</b> are checked.
For many methods, ignoring the result is perfectly
legitimate, but for some methods it is almost certainly an error. Examples of methods where ignoring
the result of a call is likely to be an error include <b>java.io.inputStream.read()</b>,
which returns the number of bytes actually read, any method on
<b>java.lang.String </b> or <b>java.math.BigInteger</b>,
as all of those methods are side-effect free and thus pointless if ignored.

<p>
Use the panel below to enter the class names and method name patterns of the methods you wish to check for
ignored returns when called.
Class names must be specified as a fully qualified name string and will match a class and all its inheritors.
Method name patterns must be specified using a Java regular expression.

Use the checkbox below to report all
calls to non-library methods where the result of that call is ignored
