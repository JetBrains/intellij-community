Reports any calls to specific methods where the result of that call is ignored.
Both methods specified in the inspection's settings and methods annotated with
<b>org.jetbrains.annotations.Contract(pure=true)</b> are checked.
For many methods, ignoring the result is perfectly
legitimate, but for some methods it is almost certainly an error. Examples of methods where ignoring
the result of a call is likely to be an error include <b>java.io.inputStream.read()</b>,
which returns the number of bytes actually read, any method on
<b>java.lang.String </b> or <b>java.math.BigInteger</b>,
as all of those methods are side-effect free and thus pointless if ignored.

<p>
Use the panel below to enter the class names and method names of the methods you wish to check for
ignored returns. Class names must be specified as a simple string, while method names may be
specified using a standard Java regular expression. Specifying a class names implicitly specifies
that class and all of its subclasses.

Use the checkbox below to report all
calls to non-library methods where the result of that call is ignored
