Reports a variety of redundant String-related operations like calling <b>string.toString()</b> or <b>string.substring(0)</b>.
Also, reports usage of redundant String constructors like <b>new String()</b> (equivalent to <b>""</b>) or <b>new String(anotherString)</b>
(equivalent to <b>anotherString</b>). Such code, when fixed, may change the program semantics if String referential equality is
important (which is commonly considered as a bad practice). In this case, consider suppressing the warning or using the inspection option
to disable reporting such problems.
