Reports any calls to a simple property setter from within the property's class.
A simple property setter is defined as one which simply assigns the value of its parameter to a field,
and does no other calculation. Such simple setter calls may be safely inlined, at a small performance
improvement. Some coding standards also suggest against the use of simple setters for code clarity
reasons.

<p>
Use the first option below to only report on setter calls on <b>this</b>, not on objects of the same type passed in as a parameter. Use
the second option below to only report when the setter is <b>private</b>.
