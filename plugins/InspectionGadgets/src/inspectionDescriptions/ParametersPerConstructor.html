Reports constructors with too many parameters.
Constructors with too many parameters can be a good sign that refactoring is necessary, e.g. by applying the builder pattern.
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  public BankAccount(long accountNumber, String owner, double balance, double interestRate) {
    // fields initialization
  }
</pre>
<p>
Such object is hard to instantiate, especially if some parameters are optional. 
It is better to rewrite such code using the builder pattern.
