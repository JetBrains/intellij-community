Reports static methods that are marked <code>final</code>.<br>
Such code may indicate an error or incorrect assumption about the effect of the <code>final</code> keyword.
Static methods are not subject to runtime polymorphism, so the only purpose of the <code>final</code> keyword with static methods
is to ensure the method will not be hidden in a subclass.
