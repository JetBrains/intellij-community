Reports methods declared <b>final</b> and <b>static</b>.
When a <b>static</b> method is overridden in a subclass it can still be
accessed via the super class, making a <b>final</b> declaration not very necessary.
Declaring a <b>static</b> method <b>final</b>
does prevent subclasses from defining a <b>static</b> method with the same
signature.
