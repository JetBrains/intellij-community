Reports static methods that are marked as <code>final</code>.
<p>Such code might indicate an error or an incorrect assumption about the effect of the <code>final</code> keyword.
Static methods are not subject to runtime polymorphism, so the only purpose of the <code>final</code> keyword used with static methods
  is to ensure the method will not be hidden in a subclass.</p>
