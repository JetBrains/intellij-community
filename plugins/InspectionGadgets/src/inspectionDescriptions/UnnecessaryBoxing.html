Reports explicit boxing, i.e. wrapping of primitive values in objects.
Explicit manual boxing is unnecessary under Java 5 and newer, and can be safely removed.
<p>
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to only report truly superfluous boxing, where a boxed value will immediately be implicitly or explicitly unboxed.
In this case the entire boxing-unboxing step can be removed. Simple explicit boxing will not be reported.
