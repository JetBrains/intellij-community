Reports explicit boxing, i.e. wrapping of primitive values in objects.
Explicit manual boxing is unnecessary under Java 5 and newer, and can be safely removed.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to only report truly superfluous boxing, where a boxed value will immediately be implicitly or explicitly unboxed.
In this case the entire boxing-unboxing step can be removed. Simple explicit boxing will not be reported.
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 5 or higher</p>
