Reports <b>equals()</b> being called
to compare two arrays. Calling <b>equals()</b> on an array
compares identity and is equivalent to using <b>==</b>. Use
<b>Arrays.equals()</b> to compare the contents of two arrays
or <b>Arrays.deepEquals()</b> to compare the content of two
multi-dimensional arrays.
