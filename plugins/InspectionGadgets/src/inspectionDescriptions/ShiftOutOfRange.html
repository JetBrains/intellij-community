Reports shift operations
where the value shifted by is constant and outside of the reasonable range. Integer
shift operations outside of the range <code>0..31</code> and long shift operations outside of the
range <code>0..63</code> are reported. Shifting by negative or overly large values is almost certainly
a coding error.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  int shiftSize = 32;
  // Warning: shift by 32 bits is equivalent to shift by 0 bits, so there's no shift at all. 
  int mask = (1 << shiftSize) - 1;
