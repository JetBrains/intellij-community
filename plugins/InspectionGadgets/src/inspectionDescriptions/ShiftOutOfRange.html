Reports shift operations
where the value shifted by is constant and outside of the reasonable range. Integer
shift operations outside of the range <b>0..31</b> and long shift operations outside of the
range <b>0..63</b> are reported. Shifting by negative or overly large values is almost certainly
a coding error.
