This inspection reports any clases which extend <b>java.lang.Thread</b>.
It is usually thought better practice to delegate to rather than extend
<b>java.lang.Thread</b>, so that a thread creator may exert better
control over the thread's behavior, and to better localize all concurrency related operations.
