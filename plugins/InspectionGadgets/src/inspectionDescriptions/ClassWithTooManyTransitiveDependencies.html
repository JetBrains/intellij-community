This global inspection reports any classes which are directly or indirectly dependent
on too many other classes in your project. Such classes may be prone to instability,
as changes to any of the classes it is dependent on may require changing the class.
Only top-level classes are reported by this inspection.
Since this inspection requires global code analysis, it is only available in batch inspection mode.
<p>
Use the field below to specify the maximum number of direct or indirect dependencies
a class may have before triggering this inspection
