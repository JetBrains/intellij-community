Reports any classes which are directly or indirectly dependent
on too many other classes. Such classes may be prone to instability,
as changes to any of the classes it is dependent on may require changing the class.
Only top-level classes are reported by this inspection.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
