Reports <code>toString()</code> calls on objects of a class extending <code>Number</code>.
Such calls are usually incorrect in an internationalized environment and some locale specific formatting should be used instead.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void print(Double d) {
    System.out.println(d.toString());
  }
</code></pre>
A possible way to fix this problem could be:
<pre><code>
  void print(Double d) {
    System.out.printf("%f%n", d);
  }
</code></pre>
This formats the number using the default locale which is set during the startup of the JVM and is based on the host environment.
