Reports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> violations.
<p>The Law of Demeter specifies a style guideline: never call a method on an object you got from another call.
The code that follows this guideline is easier to maintain, adapt, and refactor, has less coupling between methods, less duplication,
  and better information hiding. On the other hand, you might need to write many wrapper methods to meet this guideline.</p>
