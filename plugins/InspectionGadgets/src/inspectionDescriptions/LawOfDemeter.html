Reports any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> violations.
The Law of Demeter specifies a style guideline: never call a method on an object you got from another call.
Code following this style is said to be easier to maintain, adapt and refactor, with less coupling between methods, less duplication,
and better information hiding. On the other hand it may result in having to write many wrapper methods.
