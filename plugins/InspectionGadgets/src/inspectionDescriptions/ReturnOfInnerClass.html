Reports <b>return</b> statements returning an instance of an anonymous, local, or inner class.
Such instances keep an implicit reference to the outer instance.
Which means the instance can prevent the outer instance from being garbage collected.
Any caller of a method which returns such an instance might cause a memory leak by holding on to the instance returned.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore returns from <b>protected</b> or package-private methods.
Returns from <b>private</b> methods are always ignored.
