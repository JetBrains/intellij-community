Reports <b>static</b> methods which
are only called from one class which is not the same as the class containing the
method. Such methods could be moved into that class.
Methods called from an anonymous class inside the method's class are ignored.
<p>
This inspection may be cpu intensive.

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection not report when the static method is only used from a test class.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore method calls from inside all anonymous classes.
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to not warn on methods which cannot be moved without problems.
For example because a method with an identical signature is already present in the target class.
Or because a field or method used inside the method will not be accessible when the method is moved.
