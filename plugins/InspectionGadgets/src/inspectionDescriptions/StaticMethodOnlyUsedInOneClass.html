Reports <b>static</b> methods and fields which
are only used from a different class than the class containing the
method. Such members could be moved into the using class.
Factory methods and members accessed from an anonymous class inside the member's class are ignored by this inspection.
Convenience overloads, which call a method with the same name in the same class, but have fewer parameters, are also ignored.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection not report when the static member is only used from a test class.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore member usages from inside anonymous, local and non-static inner classes.
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to not warn on members which cannot be moved without problems.
For example because a method with an identical signature is already present in the target class.
Or because a field or method used inside the method will not be accessible when the method is moved.
<p>
Use the fourth checkbox to ignore members located in utility classes.
