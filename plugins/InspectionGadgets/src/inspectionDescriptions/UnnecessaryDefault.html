Reports enum <b>switch</b> statements or expression with <b>default</b> branches which can never be taken,
because all possible values are covered by a <b>case</b> branch.
These are unnecessary, especially for <b>switch</b> expressions, because they don't compile when all
<b>enum</b> constants are not covered by a <b>case</b> branch.
<p>
  The language level needs to be configured to 13 Preview to report <b>switch</b> expressions.
