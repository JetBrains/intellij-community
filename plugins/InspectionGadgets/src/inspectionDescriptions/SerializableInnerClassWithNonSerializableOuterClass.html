Reports <b>Serializable</b> non-static
inner classes whose outer classes are non-<b>Serializable</b>. Such classes
are unlikely to serialize correctly, due to implicit references from the inner to outer class.

<p>
Use the table below to specify what specific classes and inheritors should be excluded
from being checked by this inspection. This is meant for those classes which, although they inherit
Serializable from a superclass, are not intended for serialization. Such classes would lead this
inspection to report unnecessarily.
