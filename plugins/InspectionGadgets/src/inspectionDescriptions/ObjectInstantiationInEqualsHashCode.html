Reports construction of (temporary) new objects inside an <b>equals()</b>, <b>hashCode()</b>, <b>compareTo</b> or
<b>Comparator.compare()</b> method.
Besides constructor invocations, new objects can also be created by autoboxing or iterator creation inside a foreach statement.
This can cause performance problems for example when objects are added to a <b>Set</b> or <b>Map</b>,
where these methods will be called often.
This inspection will not warn when the objects are created in a <b>throw</b> or <b>assert</b> statement.
