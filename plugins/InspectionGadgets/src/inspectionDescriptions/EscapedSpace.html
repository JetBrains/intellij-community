Reports uses of <code>"\s"</code> escape sequence anywhere except text-block line endings or within series of several spaces.
The <code>"\s"</code> escape sequence is intended to encode a space at the end of text-block lines where normal spaces are trimmed.
In other locations, as well as in regular string literals, <code>"\s"</code> is identical to an ordinary space character (<code>"&nbsp;"</code>).
Use of <code>"\s"</code> is confusing and can be a mistake, especially if the string is interpreted as a regular expression.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  if (str.matches("\s+")) {...}
</code></pre>
Here it's likely that <code>"\\s+"</code> was intended (to match any whitespace character). If not, using <code>str.matches("&nbsp;+")</code>
would be less confusing.
<p>
  The quick-fix is provided that simply replaces <code>\s</code> with a space character.
