Reports <b>for</b> loops which iterate
over collections or arrays, and can be replaced with an enhanced <b>for</b> loop (i.e. the foreach iteration syntax).
<!--  'foreach' still used in this description so that the inspection continues to be found using this keyword -->
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to find loops involving <b>list.get(index)</b> calls.
These loops generally can be replaced with an enhanced <b>for</b> loop, unless they modify underlying list in the process, e.g. by calling <b>list.remove(index)</b>.
If latter is the case, the enhanced <b>for</b> loop may throw <b>ConcurrentModificationException</b>.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore collections which do not have type parameters. This prevents the creation of
enhanced <b>for</b> loop variables of type <b>java.lang.Object</b> and the insertion of casts where the loop variable is used.
<p>This inspection only reports if the language level of the project or module is 5 or higher</p>
