If latter is the case, <b>foreach</b> form of loop may throw <b>ConcurrentModificationException</b>.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore collections which do not have type parameters. This avoids the creating of
foreach loop variables of type <b>java.lang.Object</b> and casts by the quickfix

This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
