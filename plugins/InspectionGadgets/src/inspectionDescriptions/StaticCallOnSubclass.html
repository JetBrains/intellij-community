Reports static method calls where the call is qualified
by a subclass of the declaring class, rather than the declaring class itself
(e.g. <b>MyThreadSubclass.sleep()</b>). Java allows such qualification, but such calls
may be confusing, and may indicate a subtle confusion of inheritance and overriding.
