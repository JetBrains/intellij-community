Reports any attempt to instantiate a new <b>Collection</b> object without specifying
an initial capacity. If no initial capacity is specified, a default capacity is used, which will rarely be optimal. Failing
to specify initial capacities for collections may result in performance issues, if space needs to be reallocated and
memory copied when capacity is exceeded. This inspection checks allocations of the classes which are listed in inspection settings.
