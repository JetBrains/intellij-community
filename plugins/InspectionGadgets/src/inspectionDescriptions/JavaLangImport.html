Reports any <b>import</b> statements which refer to the <b>java.lang</b> package.
Such import statements are unnecessary. Since IDEA can automatically
detect and fix such statements with its "Optimize Imports" command, this inspection is mostly useful
for off-line reporting on code bases that you don't intend to change.
