Reports <code>import</code> statements that refer to the <code>java.lang</code> package.
<p>
  <code>java.lang</code> classes are always implicitly imported, so such import statements are
  redundant and confusing.
</p>
<p>
  Since IntelliJ IDEA can automatically detect and fix such statements with its <b>Optimize Imports</b> command, this inspection is mostly useful for offline reporting on code bases that you don't intend to change.
