Reports any <code>import</code> statements which refer to the <code>java.lang</code> package.
<p>
  <code>java.lang</code> classes are always implicitly imported, so such import statements are
  redundant and confusing.
</p>
<p>
  Since IDEA can automatically detect and fix such statements with its "Optimize Imports"
  command, this inspection is mostly useful for off-line reporting on code bases that you
  don't intend to change.
