<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if a Channel is allowed to be opened <i>inside</i> a <b>try</b>
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a Channel
<i>in front of</i> a <b>try</b> block.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if a Channel instance is passed as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the Channel is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <b>finally</b> block with <i>close</i> in the name and a Channel argument will not ignored.
