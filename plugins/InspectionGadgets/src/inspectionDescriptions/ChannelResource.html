Reports any <b>Channel</b> which is not opened in
front of a <b>try</b> block and closed in the corresponding
<b>finally</b> block. Such resources may be inadvertently leaked
if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed. Channel resources reported
by this inspection include any instances created by calling
<b>getChannel()</b> on a file or socket resource.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if a Channel is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a Channel
in front of a try block.
