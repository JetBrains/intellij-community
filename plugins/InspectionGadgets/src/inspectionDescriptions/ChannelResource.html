This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">Channel</font></b> which is not opened in
front of a <b><font color="#000080">try</font></b> block and closed in the corresponding
<b><font color="#000080">finally</font></b> block.  Such resources may be inadvertently leaked
if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.  Channel resources reported
by this inspection include any instances created by calling
<b><font color="#000080">getChannel()</font></b> on a file or socket resource.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if a Channel is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a Channel
in front of a try block.
