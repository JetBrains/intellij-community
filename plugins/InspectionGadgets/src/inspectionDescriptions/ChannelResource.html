Reports any <code>Channel</code> resource which is not safely closed. <code>Channel</code> resources reported
by this inspection include any instances created by calling
<code>getChannel()</code> on a file or socket resource.
<p>By default, inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with a <code>close</code> or <code>cleanup</code> in the name.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void send(Socket socket) throws IOException {
    SocketChannel channel = socket.getChannel(); //warning
    channel.write(ByteBuffer.wrap("message".getBytes()));
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if a <code>Channel</code> is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code>
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a <code>Channel</code>
in front of a <code>try</code> block.
</p>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
