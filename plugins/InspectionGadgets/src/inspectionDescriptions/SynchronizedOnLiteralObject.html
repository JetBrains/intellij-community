Reports <code>synchronized</code> blocks which lock on an object which is initialized with a literal.
<p>
  String literals are interned and <code>Character</code>, <code>Boolean</code> and <code>Number</code> literals can be allocated from a cache.
  Because of this, it is possible that some other part of the system which uses an object initialized with the same literal, is actually
  holding a reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock situations, if the lock object was thought to be private.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Main {
    final String mutex = "Mutex";
    void f() {
      synchronized (mutex) {
      }
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
  Use the <strong>"Warn on all possible literals"</strong> checkbox to warn on any synchronization on
  <code>String</code>, <code>Character</code>, <code>Boolean</code> and <code>Number</code> objects.
