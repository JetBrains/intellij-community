Reports any <b>synchronized</b>
block which locks on an object which is initialized with a literal.
String literals are interned and Character, Boolean and Number literals can be allocated from a cache.
Because of this, it is possible that some other part of the system
which uses an object initialized with the same literal, is actually holding a
reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock situations,
if the lock object was thought to be private.

Use the checkbox below to warn on any synchronization on String, Character, Boolean and Number objects.
