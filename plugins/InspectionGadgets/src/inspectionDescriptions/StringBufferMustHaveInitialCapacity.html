Reports any attempt to instantiate a new <b>StringBuffer</b> or
<b>StringBuilder</b> object without specifying its initial capacity.
If no initial capacity is specified, a default capacity is used, which will rarely be optimal. Failing
to specify initial capacities for <b>StringBuffer</b>s may result in performance issues, if space needs to be reallocated and
memory copied when capacity is exceeded
