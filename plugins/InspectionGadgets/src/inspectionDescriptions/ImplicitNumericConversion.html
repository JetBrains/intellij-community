Reports implicit conversion between numeric types.
Implicit numeric conversion is not a problem in itself, but if unexpected may be a source
of difficult to trace bugs.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below if you wish this inspection to ignore implicit conversion which
can not result in loss of data (e.g.
<b>int</b>-><b>long</b>).
<p>Use the second checkbox to indicate that this inspection should ignore conversion from
and to <b>char</b>. Conversion from floating point to <b>char</b> and vice versa will still be reported.
<p>Use the third checkbox to let this inspection ignore conversion from literals and
compile time constants.
