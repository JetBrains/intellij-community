Reports test methods of JUnit test case classes that do not contain
any assertions. Such methods indicate either incomplete or weak test cases.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the table below to specify which combinations of fully qualified class name and method name regular expression
qualify as assertions.
Class names also match subclasses.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if Java <b>assert</b> statements, using the <b>assert</b> keyword, should be considered an assertion.
<p>
Use the second checkbox to ignore test methods which declare exceptions.
This can be useful when you have tests that will throw an exception on failure and thus don't need any assertions.
