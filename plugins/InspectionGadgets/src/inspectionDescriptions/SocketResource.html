Reports any Socket resource which is not safely closed in a <b>finally</b> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed. Socket resources reported
by this inspection include <b>java.net.Socket</b>,
<b>java.net.DatagramSocket</b>,
and <b>java.net.ServerSocket</b>.

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if a Socket is allowed to be opened <i>inside</i> a <b>try</b>'
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a Socket
<i>in front of</i> a <b>try</b> block.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the inspection should not warn if a Socket is passed as a method call argument.
If enabled the inspection assumes the Socket is closed in the called method.
Method calls inside a <b>finally</b> block with <i>close</i> in the name and a Socket argument will not be ignored.
