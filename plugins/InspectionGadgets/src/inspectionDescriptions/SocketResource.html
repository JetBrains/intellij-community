Reports any Socket resource which is not opened in front of a <b>try</b>
block and closed in the corresponding <b>finally</b> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed. Socket resources reported
by this inspection include <b>java.net.Socket</b>,
<b>java.net.DatagramSocket</b>,
and <b>java.net.ServerSocket</b>.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if a Socket is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a Socket
in front of a try block.
