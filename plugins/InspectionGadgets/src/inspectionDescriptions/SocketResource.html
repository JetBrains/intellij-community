Reports any socket resource which is not safely closed. Socket resources reported
by this inspection include <code>java.net.Socket</code>,
<code>java.net.DatagramSocket</code>, and <code>java.net.ServerSocket</code>.
<p>By default, inspection assumes that the resources can be closed by any method with a <code>close</code> or <code>cleanup</code> in the name.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  byte[] getMessage(ServerSocket socket) throws IOException {
    Socket client = socket.accept(); //socket is not closed
    return client.getInputStream().readAllBytes();
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to specify if a socket is allowed to be opened inside a <code>try</code>
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a socket
in front of a <code>try</code> block.
</p>
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to specify that the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.
