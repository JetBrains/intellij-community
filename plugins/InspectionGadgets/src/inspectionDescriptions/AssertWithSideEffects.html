Reports any <code>assert</code> statements that cause side effects outside of the assert statement. Since assertions can be switched off,
the side effects are not guaranteed to happen and can cause subtle bugs. Common unwanted side effects detected by this inspection are
modifications of variables and fields in the assert statement. Also methods called are analyzed one level deep for any modifications of
fields.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  assert i++ &lt; 10;
</pre>
