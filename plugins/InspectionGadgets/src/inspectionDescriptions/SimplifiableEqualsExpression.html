This inspection reports comparisons to null which are followed by an 'equals()' call
with a constant argument.
<p>
For example the following will be reported by this inspection:
<code><pre>
    <b>if</b> (s != <b>null</b> && s.equals("literal")) {}
</pre></code>
And the quickfix will replace that with:
<code><pre>
    <b>if</b> ("literal".equals(s)) {}
</pre></code>
