Reports date format patterns that are likely used by mistake.
Usages of the following patterns are reported:
<ul>
  <li>Uppercase "Y", unless "w" appears nearby because it's a "Week year" that almost always 
    the same as normal "Year" (lowercase "y" pattern), but may point to the next year
    at the end of December.</li>
  <li>Uppercase "M" (month) close to "H", "K", "h", or "k" (hour). It's likely that a lowercase "m" (minute) was intended</li>
  <li>Lowercase "m" (minute) close to "y" (year) or "d" (day in month). It's likely that an uppercase "M" (month) was intended</li>
  <li>Uppercase "D" (day in year) close to "M", or "L" (month). It's likely that a lowercase "d" (day in month) was intended</li>
  <li>Uppercase "S" (milliseconds) close to "m" (minutes). It's likely that a lowercase "s" (seconds) was intended</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Examples:<br>
  <code>new SimpleDateFormat("YYYY-MM-dd")</code>: likely <code>"yyyy-MM-dd"</code> was intended.<br>
  <code>new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-DD")</code>: likely <code>"yyyy-MM-dd"</code> was intended.<br>
  <code>new SimpleDateFormat("HH:MM")</code>: likely <code>"HH:mm"</code> was intended.
