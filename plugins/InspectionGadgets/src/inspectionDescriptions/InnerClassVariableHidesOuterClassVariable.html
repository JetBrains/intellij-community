Reports inner class fields named identically to visible fields of the containing classes.
As a result of such naming, you may accidentally use the field from the inner class
where the identically named field of a containing class is intended.
<p>A quick-fix is suggested to rename the inner class field.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Outer {
    private String name;

    class Inner {
      private String name;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the option to choose whether this inspection should report all name clashes,
  or only clashes with fields that are visible from the inner class.
