Reports method calls in the condition part of a
loop statement. In highly resource constrained environments, such calls may
have adverse performance implications.
<p>
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  String s = "example";
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++) {
    System.out.println(s.charAt(i));
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied, the result looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  String s = "example";
  int length = s.length();
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
    System.out.println(s.charAt(i));
  }
</pre>

Use the checkbox below to ignore calls to common Java iteration methods like <code>Iterator.hasNext()</code>
  and known methods with side-effects like <code>Atomic*.compareAndSet</code>.
