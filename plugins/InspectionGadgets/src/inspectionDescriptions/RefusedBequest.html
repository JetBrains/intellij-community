Reports any methods which override concrete methods,
but which do not call that method as <b>super</b>. This is also known as a <i>refused bequest</i> and such methods
may represent a failure of abstraction which can lead to hard-to-trace bugs. Methods overridden
from <b>java.lang.Object</b> except for <b>clone()</b> are not reported by this inspection.
A <b>clone()</b> method is expected to call its super, which will automatically return an object of the correct type.

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to only warn when the super method is annotated by an annotation specified in the table below.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore super methods when they are empty or only throw an exception.
  Enabling this option can be processor intensive.
