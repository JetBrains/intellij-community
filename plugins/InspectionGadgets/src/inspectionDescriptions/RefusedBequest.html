Reports any methods which override concrete methods,
but which do not call that method as <b>super</b>. This is also known as a <i>refused bequest</i> and such methods
may represent a failure of abstraction which can lead to hard-to-trace bugs. Methods overridden
from <b>java.lang.Object</b> are not reported by this inspection.
