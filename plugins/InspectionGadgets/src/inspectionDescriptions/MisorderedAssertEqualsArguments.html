Reports calls to <code>assertEquals()</code> which have the expected argument and the actual argument in the wrong order.
For JUnit 3, 4 and 5 the correct order is <code>(expected, actual)</code>. For TestNG the correct order is <code>(actual, expected)</code>
Such calls will behave fine for assertions which pass, but may give confusing error reports on failure.
