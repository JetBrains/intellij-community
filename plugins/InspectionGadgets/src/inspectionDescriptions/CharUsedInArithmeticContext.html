This inspection reports on any expressions of type char which are used in
addition or substraction expressions
This inspection reports any instances of implicit conversion between numeric types.
Implicit numeric conversion is not a problem in itself, but if unexpected may be a source
of difficult to trace bugs.
<p>
Use the checkbox below if you wish this inspection to ignore implicit conversions which
can not result in loss of data (e.g. int->long).
