Reports JUnit 4 tests which can be automatically converted to JUnit 5. Though default runners are automatically convertable, custom runners, method- and field- rules are not and require manual changes.
This inspection requires JUnit 5 library already available on the classpath as well as JDK 1.8 or higher configured for the project.
