Reports any static fields which are only used in a different class than the one they
are defined in. Such fields can be moved.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
