This inspection reports any classes which implement a listener, but may extend
the corresponding adapter instead. The quickfix for this inspection will also
remove any redundant empty methods left over after replacing the implementation
of the listener with an extension of the corresponding adapter.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate if the inspection should warn even if no empty
implementing methods are found.
