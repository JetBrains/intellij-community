Reports <code>throws</code> clauses which contain exceptions which are more generic than the
exceptions actually thrown by the method.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public void createFile() throws Exception { // warning: 'throws Exception' is too broad, masking exception 'IOException'
    File file = new File("pathToFile");
    file.createNewFile();
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  public void createFile() throws IOException {
    File file = new File("pathToFile");
    file.createNewFile();
</code></pre>

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to have this inspection only warn on the most generic exceptions.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore overly broad <code>throws</code> clauses in methods which override a library method.
<p>
Use the third checkbox below to ignore any exceptions which hide other exceptions, but which may be thrown from the method body and thus
are technically not overly broad.
