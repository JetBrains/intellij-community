Reports <a href="https://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoubleBraceInitialization">Double Brace Initialization</a>.
Double brace initialization can cause memory leaks when used from a non-<code>static</code> context,
because the anonymous <code>class</code> created will maintain a reference to the surrounding object.
It has worse performance than regular initialization because of the additional class loading required.
It can cause <code>equals()</code> comparisons to fail, if the <code>equals()</code> method does not accept subclasses as parameter
(see link above).
And finally, before Java 9 it could not be combined with the diamond operator, because that could not be used with anonymous classes.
<p>Example of Double Brace Initialization:
<pre><code>
  List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>() {{
    add(1);
    add(2);
  }};
</code></pre>
