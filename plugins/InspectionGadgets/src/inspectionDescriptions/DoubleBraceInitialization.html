Reports <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoubleBraceInitialization">Double Brace Initialization</a>.
Double brace initialization can cause memory leaks when used from a non-<b>static</b> context,
because the anonymous <b>class</b> created will maintain a reference to the surrounding object.
It has worse performance than regular initialization because of the additional class loading required.
It can cause <b>equals()</b> comparisons to fail, if the <b>equals()</b> method does not accept subclasses as parameter (see link above).
And finally, pre Java 9 it cannot be combined with the diamond operator, because that cannot be used with anonymous classes.
