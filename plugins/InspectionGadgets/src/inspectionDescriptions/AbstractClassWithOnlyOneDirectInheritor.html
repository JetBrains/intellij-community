Reports abstract classes that have precisely one
direct inheritor. While such classes may offer admirable clarity of design,
in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments, they needlessly increase
the total footprint of the application. Consider merging the abstract class with its inheritor.
<p>
  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

<pre><code>
  abstract class Base {} // will be reported

  class Inheritor extends Base {}
</code></pre>
