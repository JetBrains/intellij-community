Reports abstract classes which have precisely one
direct inheritor. While such classes may offer admirable clarity of design,
in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments, they needlessly increase
the total footprint of the application. Consider merging the abstract class with its inheritor.

<p>
  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  abstract class Base {} // will be reported
  class Inheritor extends Base {}
</pre>
