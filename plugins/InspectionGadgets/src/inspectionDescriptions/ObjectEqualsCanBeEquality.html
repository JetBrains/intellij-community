Reports calls to <b>equals()</b> which can be replaced by <b>==</b> or <b>!=</b> expressions without a change in semantics.
These calls can be replaced when they are used to compare <b>final</b> classes which don't have their own <b>equals()</b> implementation,
but use the default <b>Object.equals()</b>.
This may result in better performance.
There is a separate inspection for <b>equals()</b> calls on Enums.
