Reports any Hibernate resource which is not opened in a <b>try</b>
block and closed in the corresponding <b>finally</b> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed. Hibernate resources reported
by this inspection include <b>org.hibernate.Session</b>.

<p>
Use the checkbox below to specify if a Hibernate resource is allowed to be opened inside a try
block. This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource
in front of a try block.
