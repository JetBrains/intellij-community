Reports accesses of inner and nested classes where the call is qualified
by a subclass of the declaring class, rather than the declaring class itself. Java
allows such qualification, but such accesses
may be confusing, and may indicate a subtle confusion of inheritance and overriding.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Super {
    static class Inner {}
  }

  class Sub extends Super {
    void test() {
      Sub.Inner s = new Sub.Inner(); // here 'Inner' class is declared in 'Super' class, but referenced via 'Sub' class
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  class Sub extends Super {
    void test() {
      Super.Inner s = new Super.Inner();
    }
  }
</pre>
