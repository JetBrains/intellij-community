Reports any calls to a variable arity method where the call has a primitive array in
in the variable arity parameter position (e.g <b>System.out.printf("%s", new int[]{1, 2, 3})</b> ).
Such a primitive-array argument may be confusing, as it will wrapped as a single-element array, rather than each individual
element being boxed, as might be expected.
