Reports <b>.equals()</b> being called
to compare two <b>java.math.BigDecimal</b> numbers. This is normally
a mistake, as two <b>java.math.BigDecimal</b>s are only equal if
they are equal in both value and scale, so that 2.0 is not equal to 2.00
To compare <b>java.math.BigDecimal</b>s for mathematical equality,
use <b>.compareTo()</b> instead.
