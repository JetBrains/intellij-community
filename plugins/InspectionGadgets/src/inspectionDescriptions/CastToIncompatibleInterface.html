Reports type cast expressions where
the cast type is an interface, and the cast expression has a class type which neither
implements the cast interface, nor has any visible subclasses which implement or extend the cast interface.
While it is possible that this was intended, such a construct is most likely an error, and will
result in a <code>java.lang.ClassCastException</code> at runtime.
<p>Example: </p>
<pre>
  interface A {}
  interface Z {}
  static class C {}

  void x(C c) {
    if (c instanceof Z) {
      A a = ((A)c); // cast to incompatible interface 'A'
    }
  }
</pre>
