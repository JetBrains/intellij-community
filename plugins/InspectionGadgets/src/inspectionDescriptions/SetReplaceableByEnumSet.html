Reports any instantiations of <b>java.util.Set</b> objects
whose content types are enumerated classes. Such <b>java.util.Set</b> objects
can be replaced by <b>java.util.EnumSet</b> objects.
<b>java.util.EnumSet</b> implementations can be much more efficient
that those of other sets, as the underlying data structure is a simple bitmap.
