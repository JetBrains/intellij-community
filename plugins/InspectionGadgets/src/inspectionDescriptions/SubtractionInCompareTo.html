Reports subtraction in
<b>compareTo()</b> methods and methods implementing <b>java.util.Comparator.compare()</b>. While it is a common idiom to
use the results of integer subtraction as the result of a <b>compareTo()</b>
method, this construct may cause subtle and difficult bugs in cases of integer overflow.
Comparing the integer values directly and returning <b>-1</b>, <b>0</b>, or <b>1</b> is better practice in most cases.
<p>
  The subtraction on floating point values which is immediately cast to integral type is also warned as precision loss is possible due to
  rounding.
</p>
<p>
The warning is not issued when it's statically determined that value ranges are limited, and overflow never occurs.
Additionally subtraction on <b>int</b> numbers greater than or equal to <b>0</b> will never overflow.
Therefore this inspection tries not to warn in those cases.
Methods that always return zero or greater can be specified in this inspection's settings.

<p>
Use the table below to specify methods which are safe to use inside a subtraction.
Methods are safe when they return an <b>int</b> value that is always greater than or equal to <b>0</b>.
Alternatively you may use <b>javax.annotation.Nonnegative</b> annotation on such methods.
