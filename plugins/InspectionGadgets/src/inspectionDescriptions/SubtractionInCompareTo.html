Reports subtraction in
<code>compareTo()</code> methods and methods implementing <code>java.util.Comparator.compare()</code>. While it is a common idiom to
use the results of integer subtraction as the result of a <code>compareTo()</code>
method, this construct may cause subtle and difficult bugs in cases of integer overflow.
Comparing the integer values directly and returning <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, or <code>1</code> is better practice in most cases.
<p>
  The subtraction on floating point values which is immediately cast to integral type is also warned as precision loss is possible due to
  rounding.
</p>
<p>
A warning is not issued when it's statically determined that value ranges are limited, and overflow never occurs.
Additionally, subtraction on <code>int</code> numbers greater than or equal to <code>0</code> will never overflow.
Therefore, this inspection tries not to warn in those cases.
Methods that always return zero or greater can be specified in this inspection's settings.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>class DoubleHolder implements Comparable&lt;DoubleHolder&gt; {
    double d;
    public int compareTo(DoubleHolder that) {
        return (int)(this.d - that.d);
    }
}
</code></pre>
A no-warning example because <code>String.length()</code> is known to be non-negative:
<pre><code>class A implements Comparable&lt;A&gt; {
    final String s = "";
    public int compareTo(A a) {
        return s.length() - a.s.length();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Use the table below to specify methods which are safe to use inside a subtraction.
Methods are safe when they return an <code>int</code> value that is always greater than or equal to <code>0</code>.
Alternatively you may use <code>javax.annotation.Nonnegative</code> annotation on such methods.
