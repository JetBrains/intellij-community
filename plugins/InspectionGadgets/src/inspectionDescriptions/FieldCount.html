This inspection reports class with too many fields. Classes with
a large number of fields are often trying to 'do too much', and may need to be
refactored into multiple smaller classes.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the controls below to specify the maximum acceptable number of fields a class might have, and
to indicate whether constant fields count toward this number. Per default this inspection only counts
immutable <b>static final</b> objects as constant. Use the checkbox below to
count any <b>static final</b> field as constant.
