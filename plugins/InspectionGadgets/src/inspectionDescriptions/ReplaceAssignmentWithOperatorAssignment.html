Reports assignment operations which can be replaced by operator-assignment. Code
using operator assignment is shorter and may be clearer.
<p>
Example:
<pre><code>
  x = x + 3;
  x = x / 3;
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick fix is applied:
<pre><code>
  x += 3;
  x /= 3;
</code></pre>

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore the conditional operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
and <code>||</code>. Replacing conditional operators with operator
assignment would change the evaluation from lazy to eager, which may change the semantics of the expression.
<p>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore the operators <code>^</code> and <code>%</code>, which are less well known.
