Reports on declarations whose modifiers are not in the canonical
preferred order (as stated in the Java Language Specification).
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to report when annotations are misplaced:
annotations with ElementType.TYPE_USE <em>not</em> directly before the type after the modifier keywords,
other annotations <em>not</em> before the modifier keywords.
When the checkbox is unchecked any annotation can be positioned before or after the modifier keywords.
Modifier lists with annotations in between modifier keywords will always be reported.
