Reports any calls to a simple property getter from within the property's class.
A simple property getter is defined as one which simply returns the value of a field,
and does no other calculation. Such simple getter calls may be safely inlined, at a small performance
improvement. Some coding standards also suggest against the use of simple getters for code clarity
reasons.

<p>
Use the first option below to only report on getter calls on <b>this</b>, not on objects of the same type passed in as a parameter. Use
the second option below to only report when the getter is <b>private</b>.
