This inspection reports any references to inner classes which are unnecessarily qualified with the name
of the enclosing class. Such qualification is unnecessary, and may be safely removed. This may
require the addition of an import for the inner class.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore references to inner classes where the removal of the qualification
would require the addition of an import.
