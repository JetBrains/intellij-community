Reports <code>public</code> methods in classes
which are not exposed as in interface. Exposing all <code>public</code> methods via interface is important for
maintaining loose coupling, and may be necessary for certain component-based programming styles.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
interface Person {
  String getName();
}
  
class PersonImpl implements Person {
  private String name;
  
  // ok: the method is exposed in the interface
  @Override
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
  
  // warning: the method is public but not exposed in the interface
  public void setName() {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
</pre>
