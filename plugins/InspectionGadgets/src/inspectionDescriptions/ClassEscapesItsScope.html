Reports usages of classes in a field or method signature when a class in a signature is less visible than the member itself.
While legal Java, such members are useless outside of the visibility scope.
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>public</code> method which returns a <code>private</code> inner <code>class</code>.</li>
  <li><code>protected</code> field whose type is a package-local <code>class</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In Java 9, a module may hide some of its classes by excluding their packages from export.
So, if the signature of exported API contains a non-exported class, such an API is useless outside of the module.

<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <b>Module's API exposes not exported classes (Java 9+)</b> option to report about the module API
    that exposes unexported classes.<br>Note that the option works if the language level of the project or module is 9 or higher.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>Public API exposes non-accessible classes</b> option to report about a public API
    that exposes non-accessible classes.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>Package-local API exposes private classes</b> option to report about package-local API
    that exposes <code>private</code> classes.</li>
</ul>
