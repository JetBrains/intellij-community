Reports any call of <b>Object.finalize()</b>. Calling
<b>Object.finalize()</b> explicitly is a very bad idea, as it can result in objects being placed in an
inconsistent state. Calls to <b>super.finalize()</b> from within implementations of <b>finalize()</b>
are benign, and are not reported by this inspection.
