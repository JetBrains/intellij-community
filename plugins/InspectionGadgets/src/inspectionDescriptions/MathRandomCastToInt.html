Reports any calls to <b>Math.random()</b> which are immediately
cast to <b>int</b>. Casting a <b>double</b> between <b>0.0</b> (inclusive) and
<b>1.0</b> (exclusive) will always round down to zero. A <b>Math.random()</b> value
should first be multiplied with some factor before casting it to an <b>int</b> to
get a value between zero (inclusive) and the multiplication factor (exclusive).
Another possible solution would be to use the <b>nextInt()</b> method of
<b>java.util.Random</b>.
