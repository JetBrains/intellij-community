Reports any Javadoc <b>@see</b>,
<b>{@link}</b> and <b>{@linkplain}</b>
tags which reference the method owning the comment, the super method of the
method owning the comment or the class containing the comment. Such links are
unnecessary and can be safely removed using this inspections quickfix. The
quickfix will remove the entire Javadoc comment if the link is its only content.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore inline links (<b>{@link}</b> and <b>{@linkplain}</b>)
to super methods. While a link to all super methods is automatically added by the
Javadoc tool, an inline link to the super method can occasionally be needed in
the text of the Javadoc.
