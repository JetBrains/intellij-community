Reports the Javadoc <code>@see</code>,
<code>{@link}</code>, and <code>{@linkplain}</code>
tags that refer to the method owning the comment, the super method of the
method owning the comment, or the class containing the comment.
<p>Such links are unnecessary and can be safely removed with this inspection's quick-fix. The
  quick-fix will remove the entire Javadoc comment if it refers to its own content.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  class Example {
    /**
     * @see Example#method
     */
    public void method() { }
  }
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre>
class Example {
  public void method() { }
}
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore inline links (<code>{@link}</code> and <code>{@linkplain}</code>)
to super methods. Although a link to all super methods is automatically added by the
Javadoc tool, an inline link to the super method may sometimes be needed in texts of the Javadoc comments.
