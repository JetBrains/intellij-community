Reports the <code>synchronized</code> modifier on methods.
<p>
There are several reasons a <code>synchronized</code> modifier on a method may be a bad idea:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    As little work as possible should be performed under a lock. Therefore it is often better to use a <code>synchronized</code> block and keep there only code that works with shared state.
  </li>
  <li>
    Synchronization becomes a part of a method's interface. This makes a transition to a different locking mechanism difficult.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keeping track of what is locking a particular object gets harder.
  </li>
  <li>
    The DoS (denial-of-service) attack becomes feasible either on purpose or unknowingly when inheriting the method's class.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  As an alternative, consider synchronizing on a <code>private final</code> lock object, access to which can be completely controlled.
</p>
<p>The quick-fix is provided to wrap the method body with <code>synchronized(this)</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    class Main {
      public synchronized void fooBar() {
      }
    }
  </code>
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    class Main {
      public void fooBar() {
        synchronized (this) {
        }
      }
    }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Use the "Options" panel to configure the inspection:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enable the <strong>"Include native methods"</strong> checkbox to include native methods into the inspection's scope.</li>
  <li>Enable the <strong>"Ignore methods overriding a synchronized method"</strong> checkbox to exclude methods that override a <code>synchronized</code> method.</li>
</ol>
