Reports calls to <code>java.lang.Runtime.exec</code> which take a dynamically-constructed string as the command to execute.
Constructed execution strings are a common source of security breaches.
By default this inspection ignores compile-time constants.
<p>Example of the reported code:</p>
<pre>
  String i = getUserInput();
  Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
  runtime.exec("foo" + i); // reports warning
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to consider any <code>static</code> <code>final</code> fields as constant.
Be careful, because strings like the following will be ignored when the option is enabled:
<pre>
  static final String COMMAND = "ping " + getDomainFromUserInput() + "'";
</pre>
