Reports synchronization on a local variable or parameter. 
<p>
  It is very difficult to guarantee correct operation when such synchronization is used.
  It may be possible to improve such code, for example, by controlling access using a synchronized wrapper class or by synchronizing on a
  field.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
  void bar() {
    final Object lock = new Object();
    synchronized (lock) { }
  }
</pre>
