Reports synchronization on a local variable or parameter. It is very difficult to guarantee correctness when such synchronization is used.
It may be possible to improve code like this by controlling access through e.g. a synchronized wrapper class, or by synchronizing on a
field.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  void bar() {
    final Object lock = new Object();
    synchronized (lock) { }
  }
</pre>
