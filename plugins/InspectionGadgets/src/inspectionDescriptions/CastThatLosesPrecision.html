Reports any cast operations between primitive numeric types which may
result in loss of precision. Such casts are not necessarily a problem, but may result in difficult to
trace bugs if the loss of precision is unexpected.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to indicate that this inspection should ignore casts from
<b>int</b> to <b>char</b>.
This type of cast is often used when implementing I/O operations, because the
<b>read()</b> method of the class
<b>java.io.Reader</b> returns an <b>int</b>.
<p>
  Use the second checkbox below to ignore casts of constant values 128-255 from <b>int</b> to <b>byte</b>.
  Such values will overflow to negative numbers that still fit inside a byte.
