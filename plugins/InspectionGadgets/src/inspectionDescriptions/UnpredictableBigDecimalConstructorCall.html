Reports calls to <b>BigDecimal</b> constructors which accept a <b>double</b> value.
These constructors produce a <b>BigDecimal</b> which is exactly equal to the supplied <b>double</b> value.
However, as doubles are encoded in <i>IEEE 754 64-bit double-precision binary floating-point</i> format, the exact value could be unexpected.
<p>
For example <code><b>new</b> BigDecimal(0.1)</code> yields a <b>BigDecimal</b> whose value is
<small><code>0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625</code></small>,
which is the nearest number to 0.1 representable as a double.
To get a <b>BigDecimal</b> which stores the same value as written in the source code,
use either <code><b>new</b> BigDecimal("0.1")</code> or <code>BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1)</code>.
