Reports on calls to <b>BigDecimal</b>
constructors which accept a <b>double</b> value.
These constructors can have somewhat unpredictable results because many numbers
cannot be represented exactly in a <b>double</b>.
It is recommended to use the <b>BigDecimal.valueOf()</b> method or the constructors which accept a <b>String</b> instead.
