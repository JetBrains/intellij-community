Reports methods that reference too many other classes.
Methods with too high coupling can be very fragile and should be probably split into smaller methods.
<p>Each referenced class is counted only once no matter how many times it is referenced.</p>
  <!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <b>Method coupling limit</b> field to specify the maximum allowed coupling for a method.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>Include couplings to java system classes</b> option to count references to classes from <code>java</code>or <code>javax</code> packages.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>Include couplings to library classes</b> option to count references to third-party library classes.</li>
</ul>
