Reports calls to the regular expression methods of
<b>java.lang.String</b> using constants arguments.
Such calls may be profitably replaced with a
<b>private static final Pattern</b> field so
that the regular expression does not have to be compiled each time it is used.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore calls to <b>String.split()</b> which are optimized in Java 7 and above.
  <b>String.split()</b> has optimizations if the regex is either a one-<b>char</b> <b>String</b>
  and this character is not one of the regex meta characters ".$|()[{^?*+\\", or
  a two-<b>char</b> <b>String</b> and the first <b>char</b> is the backslash and
  the second is not an ascii digit or ascii letter.
