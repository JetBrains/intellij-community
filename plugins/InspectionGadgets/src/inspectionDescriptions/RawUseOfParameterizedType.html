This inspection reports any uses of parameterized classes where the type parameters are omitted.
Such "raw" uses of parameterized types are valid in Java, but defeat the purpose of using
type parameters, and may mask bugs.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore the construction of objects of
parameterized types. Use the second checkbox below to ignore raw types in type
casts.
<p>
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.
