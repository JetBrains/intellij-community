Reports any uses of parameterized classes where the type parameters are omitted.
Such <i>raw</i> uses of parameterized types are valid in Java, but defeat the purpose of using
type parameters, and may mask bugs. This inspection mirrors the <i>rawtypes</i> warning of javac.
<p>
This inspection only reports if the project or module is configured to use a
language level of 5.0 or higher.
