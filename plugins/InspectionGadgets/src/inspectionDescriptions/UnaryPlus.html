Reports any uses of the unary <b>+</b> operator. Unary plus is usually a null operation, and
its presence may represent a coding error.
Particularly in combination with the increment operator, <b>+++</b>, or the equals operator, <b>=+</b>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to only report when an unary plus is used together with a binary or another unary expression.
This means the inspection won't warn when an unary plus expression is used for example as a method argument, or in an array
initializer expression. In such cases it is much less confusing.
