Reports any classes which are directly dependent on too many
other classes in the project. Such classes may be prone to instability, as modifications
to any of the classes it is dependent on may require changing the class. Only top-level
classes are reported by this inspection.

Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
