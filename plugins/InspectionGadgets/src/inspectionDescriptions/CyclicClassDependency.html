Reports any classes which are mutually or cyclically dependent on
other classes. Such cyclic dependencies make for fragile code and high maintenance costs.
Because this inspection requires global code analysis it is only available for <em>Analyze|Inspect Code</em> or
<em>Analyze|Run Inspection by Name</em> and it will not report in the editor.
