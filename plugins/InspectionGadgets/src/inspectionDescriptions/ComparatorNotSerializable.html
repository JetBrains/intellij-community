Reports on subclasses of <b>java.lang.Comparator</b> which are not
also <b>Serializable</b>. Objects of <b>java.util.TreeMap</b>
or <b>java.util.TreeSet</b> will become non-<b>Serializable</b>
if instantiated with such <b>Comparator</b>s. This can result in unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose
bugs. Since subclasses of <b>java.lang.Comparator</b> are often stateless, simply marking
them <b>Serializable</b> is a small cost to avoid such issues.
