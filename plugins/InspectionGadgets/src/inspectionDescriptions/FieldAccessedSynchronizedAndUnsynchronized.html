Reports non-final fields which are accessed in both synchronized and
unsynchronized contexts. Volatile fields and accesses in constructors and initializers are ignored by this
inspection. Such "partially synchronized" access is often the result of a coding oversight, and may
result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures.
