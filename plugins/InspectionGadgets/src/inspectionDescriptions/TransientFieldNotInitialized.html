Reports <code>transient</code> fields that
are initialized during normal object construction, but whose class does not have a
<code>readObject</code> method.
<p>
  As <code>transient</code> fields are not serialized they need
  to be initialized separately in a <code>readObject()</code> method
  during deserialization.
</p>
<p>
  Any <code>transient</code> fields that
  are not initialized during normal object construction are considered to use the default
  initialization and are not reported by this inspection.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Person implements Serializable {
    transient String name = "Default"; //warning, can actually be a null after deserialization
    transient String surname; //null is considered the default value and not reported
  }
</code></pre>
