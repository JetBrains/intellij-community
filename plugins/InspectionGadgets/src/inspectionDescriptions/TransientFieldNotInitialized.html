Reports <code>transient</code> fields which
are initialized during normal object construction, but whose class does not have a
<code>readObject</code> method.
Because <code>transient</code> fields are not serialized they need
to be initialized separately in a <code>readObject()</code> method
during deserialization.
<p>
Any <code>transient</code> fields which
are not initialized during normal object construction are considered to use the default
initialization and are not reported by this inspection.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class Person implements Serializable {
    transient String name = "Default"; //warning, can actually be a null after deserialization
    transient String surname; //null is considered as a default value
  }
</pre>
