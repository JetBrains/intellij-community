Reports <b>transient</b> fields which
are initialized during normal object construction, but whose class does not have a
<b>readObject</b> method.
Because <b>transient</b> fields are not serialized they need
to be initialized separately in a <b>readObject</b> method
during deserialization. Any <b>transient</b> fields which 
are not initialized during normal object construction are considered to use the default
initialization and are not reported by this inspection.
