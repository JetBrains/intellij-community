It's almost always a mistake to add a <b>boolean</b> parameter to a public method (part of an API) if that method is not a setter.
When reading code using such a method, it can be difficult to decipher what the <b>boolean</b> stands for without looking at
the source or documentation.
This problem is also known as <a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2011/08/hall-of-api-shame-boolean-trap.html">the boolean trap</a>.
The <b>boolean</b> parameter can often be profitably replaced with an <b>enum</b>

Use the option below to only warn when a method contains more than one boolean parameter.
