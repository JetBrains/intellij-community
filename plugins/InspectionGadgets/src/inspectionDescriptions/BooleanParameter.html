Reports public methods that accept a <code>boolean</code> parameter.
It's almost always a bad practice to add a <code>boolean</code> parameter to a public method (part of an API) if that method is not a setter.
When reading code using such a method, it can be difficult to decipher what the <code>boolean</code> stands for without looking at
the source or documentation.
This problem is also known as <a href="https://ariya.io/2011/08/hall-of-api-shame-boolean-trap">the boolean trap</a>.
The <code>boolean</code> parameter can often be profitably replaced with an <code>enum</code>.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  // Warning: it's hard to understand what boolean parameters mean when reading the code
  public boolean setPermission(File f, int access, boolean enable, boolean owneronly) {
    ...
  }
</pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the option below to only warn when a method contains more than one boolean parameter.
