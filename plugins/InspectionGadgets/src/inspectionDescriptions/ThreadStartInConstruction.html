Reports any calls to <code>start()</code> on <code>java.lang.Thread</code>
or any of its subclasses during object construction. While occasionally useful, this construct should be avoided due
to inheritance issues. Subclasses of a class which launches a thread during object construction will not have finished
any initialization logic of their own before the thread has launched.
<p>This inspection does not report if the class that starts a thread is declared as final.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  class MyThread extends Thread {
    MyThread() {
      start();
    }
  }
</code></pre>
