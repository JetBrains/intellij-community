Reports any calls to <b>start()</b> on <b>java.lang.Thread</b>
or any of its subclasses during object construction. While occasionally useful, this construct should be avoided due
to inheritance issues. Subclasses of a class which launches a thread during object construction will not have finished
any initialization logic of their own before the thread has launched.
