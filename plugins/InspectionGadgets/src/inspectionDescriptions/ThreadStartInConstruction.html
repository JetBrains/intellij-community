Reports calls to <code>start()</code> on <code>java.lang.Thread</code>
or any of its subclasses during object construction.
<p>
  While occasionally useful, such constructs should be avoided due to inheritance issues.
  Subclasses of a class that launches a thread during the object construction will not have finished
  any initialization logic of their own before the thread has launched.
</p>
<p>This inspection does not report if the class that starts a thread is declared <code>final</code>.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class MyThread extends Thread {
    MyThread() {
      start();
    }
  }
</code></pre>
