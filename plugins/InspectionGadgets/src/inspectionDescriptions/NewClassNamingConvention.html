Reports classes whose names are too short, too long, or do not follow
the specified regular expression pattern.
<p><b>Example:</b> if the inspection is enabled for tests, and the specified length for the minimum class name is 8 (the default), the following test class
   produces a warning because the length of its name is 6, which is less than 8: <code>public class MyTest{}</code>.
<p>A quick-fix that renames such classes is available only in the editor.</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<p>
  Use the list in the <b>Options</b> section to specify which classes should be checked. Deselect the checkboxes for the classes for which
  you want to skip the check.</p>
<p>For each class type, specify the minimum length, maximum length, and the regular expression expected for class names using the
  provided input fields. Specify <b>0</b> in the length fields to skip corresponding checks.</p>
<p>Regular expressions should be specified in the standard <code>java.util.regex</code> format.</p>
