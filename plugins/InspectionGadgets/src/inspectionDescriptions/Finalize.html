Reports any implementations of
a <b>finalize()</b> method. For performance reasons or due to inability
to guarantee that <b>finalize()</b> will ever be called,
some coding standards prohibit its use.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore <b>finalize()</b> implementations with an empty
method body or a body containing only if statements which have a condition which
evaluates to false at compile time. For performance reasons it can be beneficial to
override a non-trivial <b>finalize()</b> with an empty
implementation in a subclass. An empty final <b>finalize()</b>
implementation can also be used to prevent subclasses from overriding.
