Reports on <b>while</b> loops which spin on the
value of a non-volatile field, waiting for it to be changed by another thread.
<p>
In addition to being potentially extremely CPU intensive when little work is done inside the loop, such
loops are likely have different semantics than intended, as the Java Memory Model allows such field accesses
to be hoisted out of the loop, causing the loop to never complete even if another thread does change the
field's value.

<p>
  Additionally since Java 9 it's recommended to call <code>Thread.onSpinWait()</code> inside spin loop
  on a volatile field which may significantly improve performance on some hardware.
