Reports <b>java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom</b> instances which might be shared between threads.
A <b>ThreadLocalRandom</b> might be shared between threads and is reported when it is assigned to a field,
used as a method argument or assigned to a local variable and used in anonymous or nested classes.
A <b>ThreadLocalRandom</b> should not be shared between threads because that is not thread-safe.
<p>
Usages of <b>ThreadLocalRandom</b> should typically look like <b>ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(...)</b>
(or <b>nextDouble(...)</b> etc.).
When all usages are in this form, <b>ThreadLocalRandom</b> instances can not be used accidentally by multiple threads.
