Reports suspicious array casts.
An array cast is considered suspicious when it casts to a more specific array type. Such a cast is legal at compile
time but may fail with a <code>ClassCastException</code> at runtime.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  Number[] numbers = new Number[]{1L, 2L, 4L};
  Long[] longs = (Long[])numbers;
</code></pre>
