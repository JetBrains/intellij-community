This inspection reports string concatenations where the left literal does not
end with whitespace and the right literal does not start with whitespace. For example:
<pre><code>
  String sql = "SELECT column" +
               "FROM table";
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to have this inspection only report when both the left and right side of the concatenation are string literals.
