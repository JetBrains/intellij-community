Reports <code>synchronized</code> statements with empty bodies.
<p>
  Empty <code>synchronized</code> statements are sometimes used to wait for other threads to
  release a particular resource. However, there is no guarantee that the same resource
  won't be acquired again right after the empty <code>synchronized</code> statement finishes.
  For proper synchronization, the resource should be utilized inside the <code>synchronized</code> block.
</p>
<p>
  Also, an empty <code>synchronized</code> block may appear after a refactoring
  when redundant code was removed. In this case, the <code>synchronized</code> block
  itself will be redundant and should be removed as well.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  synchronized(lock) {}
</code></pre>
<p>
  A quick-fix is suggested to remove the empty synchronized statement.
