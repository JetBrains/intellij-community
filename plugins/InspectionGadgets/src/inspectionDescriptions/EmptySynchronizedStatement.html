Reports <code>synchronized</code> statements having empty bodies.
Empty <code>synchronized</code> statements are sometimes used to wait till other threads
release a particular resource. However, nobody guarantees that the same resource
won't be acquired again right after the empty <code>synchronized</code> statement finishes.
For proper synchronization, the resource should be utilized inside the synchronized block.
<p>
  Also, empty <code>synchronized</code> block may appear during the refactoring 
  when redundant code was deleted. In this case, the <code>synchronized</code> block
  itself will be redundant and should be deleted as well.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  synchronized(lock) {}
</code></pre>
<p>
  A quick-fix is suggested to remove empty synchronized statement.
