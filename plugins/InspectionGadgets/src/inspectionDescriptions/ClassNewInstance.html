Reports any calls to
<b>java.lang.Class.newInstance()</b>.
The <b>newInstance</b> method propagates any
exception thrown by the no-arg constructor, including checked exceptions. Use
of this method effectively bypasses the compile-time exception checking that
would otherwise be performed by the compiler. Replacing such a method call with
a call to the <b>java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance()</b>
method avoids this problem by wrapping any exception thrown by the constructor
in a <b>java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException</b>.
