Reports any <b>Serializable</b> classes which do not provide a <b>serialVersionUID</b> field.
Without a <b>serialVersionUID</b> field, any change to a class will make previously serialized versions unreadable.

Use the table below to specify what specific classes and inheritors should be excluded
from being checked by this inspection. This is meant for those classes which, although they inherit
Serializable from a superclass, are not intended for serialization. Such classes would lead this
inspection to report unnecessarily.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore <b>Serializable</b> anonymous classes.
