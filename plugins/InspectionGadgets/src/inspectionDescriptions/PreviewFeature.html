Reports usages of the Preview Feature API. The Preview Feature API is a set of elements that are annotated with <code>@PreviewFeature</code>.
<p>
  A preview feature is a new feature of the Java language, Java Virtual Machine, or Java SE API that is fully specified, fully implemented,
  and yet impermanent. The notion of a preview feature is defined in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12">JEP 12</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If a code depends on a preview feature it might stop compiling in the future JDK versions if the feature get no positive feedback and,
  hence, it either gets removed or changed.
