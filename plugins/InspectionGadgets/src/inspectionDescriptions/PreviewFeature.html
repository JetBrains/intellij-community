Reports usages of the Preview Feature API: a set of elements that are annotated with <code>@PreviewFeature</code>.
<p>
  A preview feature is a new feature of the Java language, Java Virtual Machine, or Java SE API that is fully specified, fully implemented,
  and is yet impermanent. The notion of a preview feature is defined in <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12">JEP 12</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If a piece of code depends on a preview feature, it might stop compiling in future JDK versions in case the feature gets no positive
  feedback and gets removed or changed.
