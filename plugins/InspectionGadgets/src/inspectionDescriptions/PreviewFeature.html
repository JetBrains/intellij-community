Reports usages of Preview Feature APIs, i.e. of a module, package, class, interface, method, constructor, field, or enum constant
in the <code>java.*</code> or <code>javax.*</code> namespace annotated with <code>@PreviewFeature</code>.
<p>
  A preview feature is a new feature of the Java language, Java Virtual Machine, or Java SE API that is fully specified, fully implemented,
  and is yet impermanent. The notion of a preview feature is defined in <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">JEP 12</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If some piece of code depends on a preview API, it may stop compiling in future JDK versions if the feature is changed or removed.
