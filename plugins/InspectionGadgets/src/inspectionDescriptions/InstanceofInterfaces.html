Reports on uses of <b>instanceof</b> or <b>getClass() == SomeClass.class</b> where the type checked for is a concrete class,
rather than an interface. Such uses often indicate excessive coupling to concrete implementations, rather
than abstractions. <b>instanceof</b> expressions whose classes come from system or third-party libraries will not be reported by this inspection.

Use the checkbox below to have this inspection ignore <b>instanceof</b> on abstract classes.
