Reports any methods which may safely be made <code>static</code>. 
Using static methods can reduce memory consumption and improve your code quality.
<p>A method may be <code>static</code> iff:
<ul>
  <li>
    it is not <code>synchronized</code>, <code>native</code> or <code>abstract</code> 
  </li>
  <li>
    does not reference any of non-static methods and non-static fields from containing class
  </li>
  <li>
    is not an override and is not overridden in a subclass
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Use the first checkbox below to inspect only <code>private</code>
or <code>final</code> methods, which increases the
performance of this inspection.
<p>
Use the second checkbox to ignore empty methods.
<p>
Use the third checkbox to ignore default methods in interface when using Java 8 or higher
<p>
Use the fourth checkbox to let the quick fix replace instance qualifiers with class references
in calls to methods which are made <code>static</code>,
i.e. call <code>myClass.m()</code> would be replaced with <code>MyClass.m()</code>
