Reports methods that can safely be made <code>static</code>.
Making methods static when possible can reduce memory consumption and improve your code quality.
<p>A method can be <code>static</code> if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    it is not <code>synchronized</code>, <code>native</code> or <code>abstract</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
    does not reference any of non-static methods and non-static fields from the containing class,
  </li>
  <li>
    is not an override and is not overridden in a subclass.
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Use the following options to configure the inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether to report only <code>private</code> and <code>final</code> methods, which increases the performance of this inspection.</li>
  <li>Whether to ignore empty methods.</li>
  <li>Whether to ignore default methods in interface when using Java 8 or higher.</li>
  <li>
    Whether to let the quick-fix replace instance qualifiers with class references
    in calls to methods which are made <code>static</code>,
    that is, call <code>myClass.m()</code> would be replaced with <code>MyClass.m()</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
