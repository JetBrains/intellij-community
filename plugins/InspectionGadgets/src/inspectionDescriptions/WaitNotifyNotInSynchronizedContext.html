Reports on any call to <b>wait()</b>, <b>notify()</b> or <b>notifyAll()</b> not made inside a corresponding synchronized
statement or synchronized method. Calling <b>wait()</b>, <b>notify()</b> or <b>notifyAll()</b> on an object
without holding a lock on that object will result in an <b>IllegalMonitorStateException</b> being thrown.
Such a construct is not necessarily an error, as the necessary lock may be acquired before
the containing method is called, but its worth looking at.
