Reports ambiguous super method calls from inside an inner or anonymous class, where a method
with identical signature is available in the surrounding class. In this situation a cursory
examination of the code may suggest a method in the surrounding class is
called, when in actual fact a method from the super class is called. To clarify the
intent of the code it is recommended to add a
<b>super</b> qualifier to the method call.
