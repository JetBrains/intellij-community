Reports any method calls to super methods where a method
with the same name is available in the surrounding class. In this case a cursory
reader of the code may think that a method in the surrounding class is
called, when in fact a method from the super class is called. To make the
intent of the code more clear it is recommended to add a
<b>super</b> qualifier to the method call.
