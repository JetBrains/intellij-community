Reports Javadoc comments that don't belong to any class, method or field.
The Javadoc tool ignores dangling Javadoc comments and doesn't include them in the HTML documentation it generates.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class A {
    /**
     * Dangling comment
     */
    /**
     * Method javadoc
     */
     public void m(){}
  }
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix is available to delete such comments completely or convert them into a block comment. After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  class A {
    /*
      Dangling comment
    */
    /**
     * Method javadoc
     */
    public void m(){}
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Use the <b>Ignore file header comment in JavaDoc format</b> option to ignore comments at the beginning of Java files.
These are usually copyright messages.
