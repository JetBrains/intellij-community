Reports <code>instanceof</code> expressions where
the compared type is an interface, and the compared expression has a class type which neither
implements the compared interface, nor has any visible subclasses which implement or extend the compared interface.
While it is possible that this was intended, such a construct is most likely an error, where
the resulting <code>instanceof</code> expression always evaluates to <code>false</code>.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  interface I1 {}

  interface I2 {}

  interface I3 extends I1 {}

  static class Sub1 implements I1 {}

  static class Sub2 extends Sub1 implements I2 {
    void test(Sub1 sub1) {
      if (sub1 instanceof I3) { // here 'I3' is incompatible interface
      }
    }
  }
