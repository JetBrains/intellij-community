Reports any constant new array expression, like <code>int[] a = new int[]{42}</code> which can be replaced
with an array initializer, e.g. <code>int[] a = {42}</code>. Array initializers omit the type declaration because
that is already specified by the declaration of the variable the expression is
assigned to.
