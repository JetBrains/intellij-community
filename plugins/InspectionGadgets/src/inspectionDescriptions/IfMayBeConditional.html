Reports any <b>if</b>
statements with then and <b>else</b> branches which
are both assignment expressions or both <b>return</b>
statements. The same semantics can be expressed more compactly, and arguably
more clearly, with a conditional expression. Example:
<pre>
  <b>if</b> (foo == null) {
    bar = null;
  } <b>else</b> {
    bar = foo.get();
  }
</pre>
may be expressed as:
<pre>
  bar = foo == null ? null : foo.get();
</pre>

Use the checkbox below to let this inspection report <b>if</b> statements containing method calls which can be replaced with a single
method call with a conditional expression argument.
