Reports conditional expressions which are negated with a prefix expression, as
such constructions may be confusing.
<p>There is a fix that propagates the outer negation to both branches.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  !(i == 1 ? a : b)
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  i == 1 ? !a : !b
</code></pre>
