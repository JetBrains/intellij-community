Reports conditional expressions which are negated with a prefix expression, as
such constructions may be confusing.
<p>There is a fix that propagates the outer negation to both branches.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>!(i == 1 ? a : b)</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre>i == 1 ? !a : !b</pre>
