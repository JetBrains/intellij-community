Reports expressions that can be replaced with a call to <code>java.util.Objects.equals()</code>, which is available since JDK 1.7.
For example:
<code><pre>a != <b>null</b> <b>&&</b> a.equals(b)</pre></code>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  If <code>a.equals(b)</code> isn't preceded with <code>a != <b>null</b></code>, replacing it with <code>Objects.equals(a, b)</code>
  still makes sense, but slightly changes the semantics. For the cases where only equivalent replacement is needed, there's
  the check box <i>Report only null safe 'equals' calls</i> to enforce that.
<p>
  This inspection only applies to projects and modules configured to use a language level of 7 or higher.
