Reports classes which are highly coupled, i.e. that reference too many other classes.
Classes with too high a coupling can be very fragile, and should probably be broken up. References to system classes
(those in the <b>java.</b>or <b>javax.</b> packages), are not
counted for purposes of this inspection.
