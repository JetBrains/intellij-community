Reports <b>.notify()</b> or
<b>.notifyAll()</b> being called without any detectable state change occurring.
Normally, <b>.notify()</b> and <b>.notifyAll()</b> are
used to inform other threads that a state change has occurred. That state change should occur in a synchronized
context that contains the <b>.notify()</b> or
<b>.notifyAll()</b> call, and prior to the call. While not having such a state change
isn't necessarily incorrect, it is certainly worth examining.
