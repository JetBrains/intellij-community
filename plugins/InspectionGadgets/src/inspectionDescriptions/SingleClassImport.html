Reports any <b>import</b> statements which cover single classes (as opposed to entire packages).
Some coding standards prohibit such <b>import</b> statements. Since IDEA can automatically
detect and fix such statements with its "Optimize Imports" command, this inspection is mostly useful
for off-line reporting on code bases that you don't intend to change.
