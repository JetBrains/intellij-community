Reports <code>import</code> statements that import single classes (as opposed to entire packages).
<p>Some coding standards prohibit such <code>import</code> statements.</p>
<p>
  You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to detect and fix such statements with its <b>Optimize Imports</b> command. Go to
  <a href="settings://preferences.sourceCode.Java?Use%20single%20class%20import">Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Imports</a>
  and clear the <b>Use single class import</b> checkbox. Thus this inspection is mostly useful for
  offline reporting on code bases that you don't intend to change.
