Reports any <code>import</code> statements which cover single classes (as opposed to entire packages).
<p>Some coding standards prohibit such <code>import</code> statements.</p>
<p>
  You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to detect and fix such statements with its "Optimize Imports"
  command. To do this, go to
  <a href="settings://preferences.sourceCode.Java?Use%20single%20class%20import">Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Imports</a>
  and clear the "Use single class import" checkbox. Thus this inspection is mostly useful for
  off-line reporting on code bases that you don't intend to change.
