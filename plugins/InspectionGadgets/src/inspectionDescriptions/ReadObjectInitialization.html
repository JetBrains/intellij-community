Reports fields which are not guaranteed to be initialized after the object is
deserialized by the <code>readObject()</code> method.
Inspection doesn't report transient fields.
<p>
  Note: This inspection uses a very conservative control flow algorithm, and may report fields
  as uninitialized incorrectly.
</p>
<p>Example of the reported code:</p>
<pre>
class DataObject implements Serializable {
  String s; // s is not initialized in readObject
  int i;

  private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream) throws IOException {
    i = stream.readInt();
  }
}
</pre>
