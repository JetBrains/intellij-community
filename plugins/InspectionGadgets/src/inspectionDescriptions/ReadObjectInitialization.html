This inspection reports variables which are not guaranteed to be initialized after the object is
deserialized by the <b>readObject()</b> method.
<p>
Note: This inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report instance variables
as uninitialized incorrectly. Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.
