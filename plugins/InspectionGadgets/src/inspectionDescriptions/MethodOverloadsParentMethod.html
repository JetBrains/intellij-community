Reports instance methods having the same name and the same number of parameters with the same or compatible types as
a method in a superclass. In this case, the child method overloads the parent method, instead of overriding it.
While that may be intended, if unintended it may result in latent bugs.

<p>
Use the checkbox below also report even if the parameter types are not compatible.
