Reports instance methods with the same name and the same number of parameters as a method in a superclass,
but where at least one of the parameters is of a different incompatible type.
<p>
  In this case, the method in a subclass will be overloading the method from the superclass
  instead of overriding it. If it is unintended, it may result in latent bugs.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public class Foo {
    void foo(int x) {}
  }

  public class Bar extends Foo {
    void foo(Number x) {} // Method 'foo()' overloads a compatible method of a superclass,
                          // when overriding might have been intended
  }
</code></pre>

<p>
  Use the option to choose whether the inspection should also report cases where parameter types are not compatible.
