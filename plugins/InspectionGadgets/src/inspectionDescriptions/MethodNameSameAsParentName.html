Reports methods that have the same name as the superclass of the method's class, as
such a method name may be confusing.
<p>This inspection doesn't check interfaces or superclasses deep in the hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b>
<pre><code>
  class Parent {}
  class Child extends Parent {
     public Parent Parent() {
       return null;
     }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix that renames such methods is available only in the editor.</p>
