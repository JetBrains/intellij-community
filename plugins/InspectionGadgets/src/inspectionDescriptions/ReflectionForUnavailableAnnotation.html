This inspection reports any attempts to reflectively check for the presence of an
annotation which is not defined has being retained at runtime.
Using <b>Class.isAnnotationPresent()</b> to test for an annotation
which has source retention or class-file retention (the default) will always result in a negative result,
but is easy to do inadvertently.
