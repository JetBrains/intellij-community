Reports <code>import</code> statements that refer to the same package as the
containing file.
<p>
  Same-package files are always implicitly imported, so such <code>import</code>
  statements are redundant and confusing.
</p>
<p>
  Since IntelliJ IDEA can automatically detect and fix such statements with its <b>Optimize Imports</b>
  command, this inspection is mostly useful for offline reporting on code bases that you
  don't intend to change.
