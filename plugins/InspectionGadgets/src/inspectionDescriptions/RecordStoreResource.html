Reports any Java ME <code>javax.microedition.rms.RecordStore</code> resource which is not opened in front
of a <code>try</code> block and closed in the corresponding <code>finally</code> block.
<p>Such resources may be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.</p>
<p>
  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments. Applying
  the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and
  design.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
  void foo1() throws RecordStoreException {
      RecordStore rs = RecordStore.openRecordStore("bar", true); // warning
  }
  void foo2() throws RecordStoreException {
      RecordStore rs = RecordStore.openRecordStore("bar", true); // no warning
      try {
          /* ... */
      } finally {
          rs.closeRecordStore();
      }
  }
