This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports any J2ME RecordStore resource which is not opened in front of a <b>try</b>
block and closed in the corresponding <b>finally</b> block. Such resources may
be inadvertently leaked if an exception is thrown before the resource is closed.
