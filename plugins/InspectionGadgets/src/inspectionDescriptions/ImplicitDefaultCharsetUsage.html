Reports method and constructor calls which implicitly use the platform's default charset.
These can produce different results on (e.g. foreign language) systems that use a different default charset,
resulting in unexpected behaviour. A quick-fix could be suggested to specify explicit UTF-8 charset
if the corresponding overloaded method is available.
