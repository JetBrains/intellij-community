Reports logging calls with non-constant arguments which are not surrounded by a guard condition.
The evaluation of the arguments of a logging call can be expensive.
Surrounding a logging call with a guard clause prevents that cost, when the logging
is disabled for the level used by the logging statement. This is especially useful for the
least serious level (trace, debug, finest) of logging calls, because those are
most often disabled in a production environment.
