Reports log statements with non-constant arguments which are not
surrounded by a guard condition.
The evaluation of the arguments of a log statement can be expensive.
Surrounding a log statement with a guard clause prevents that cost when the logging
is disabled for the level used by the logging statement. This is especially for the
least serious level (trace, debug, finest) of logging statements, because those are
most often disabled in a production environment.
