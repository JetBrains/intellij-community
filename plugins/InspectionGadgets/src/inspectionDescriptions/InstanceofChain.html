Reports any chains of <b>if</b>-<b>else</b> statements all of whose conditions are <b>instanceof</b> expressions
or class equality expressions (e.g. comparison with <b>String.class</b>).
Such constructions usually indicate a failure of object-oriented design, which
dictates that such type-based dispatch should be done via polymorphic method calls rather than explicit chains
of type tests.
