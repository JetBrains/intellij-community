Reports pointless or pointlessly
complicated boolean expressions. Such expressions include <b>and</b>ing with <b>true</b>,
<b>or</b>ing with <b>false</b>,
equality comparison with a boolean literal, or negation of a boolean literal. Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
