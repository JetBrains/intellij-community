Reports fields with the same name as a field in an ancestor class. Such field
names may be confusing, and can be bug-prone.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>class Parent {
  Parent parent;
}
class Child extends Parent {
  Child parent;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A quick-fix to rename the field is suggested only in the editor.</p>
