Reports calls to <code>wait()</code> methods that may occur while the current thread is holding two locks.
Since the call to <code>wait()</code> releases the only lock on its target,
waiting with two locks held can easily lead to deadlock.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  synchronized (lockA) {
    synchronized (lockB) {
      lockB.wait(); //warning
      //thread A is stuck here holding lockA
    }
  }

  synchronized (lockA) { //thread B can't enter the block and release thread A
    lockB.notify();
  }
</pre>
