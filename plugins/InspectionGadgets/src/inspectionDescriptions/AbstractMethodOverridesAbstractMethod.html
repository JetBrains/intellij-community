Reports abstract methods which override abstract methods.
<p>They don't make sense because any concrete child class will have to implement the abstract method anyway.</p>
<p>
  Methods with different return types, exception declarations, annotations or modifiers than the method they override
  are not reported by this inspection.

  Use the checkbox below to ignore any abstract methods that have a different JavaDoc comment than their super method.
