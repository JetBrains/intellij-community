Reports on any access to a non-constant static field which is
locked on either <code>this</code> or an instance field of <code>this</code>.
<p>
  Locking a static field on instance data does not prevent the field from being
  modified by other instances, and thus may result in surprising race conditions.
</p>
<p>
  The quick-fix allows to ignore static fields with reference type of the field
  which is accessed. You can manage ignored classes in the inspection settings.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  static String s;
  public void foo() {
      synchronized (this) {
          System.out.println(s); // warning
      }
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Use the table below to specify classes to ignore. Any static fields of the types
  specified will be ignored by this inspection.
