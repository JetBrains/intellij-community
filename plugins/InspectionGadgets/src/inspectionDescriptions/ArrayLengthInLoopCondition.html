Reports any access to the <code>.length</code> of an array in the condition part of a
loop statement. In highly resource constrained environments, such calls may
have adverse performance implications.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  void foo(Object[] x) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) { /**/ }
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->

  This inspection is intended for Java ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
  Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
