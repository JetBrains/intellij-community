Reports methods returning <b>this</b>.
While such a return is valid, it is rarely necessary, and usually indicates that the developer intends the method to be used
as part of a chain of similar method calls (e.g. buffer.append("foo").append("bar").append("baz")).
Such chains are frowned upon by many coding standards.
