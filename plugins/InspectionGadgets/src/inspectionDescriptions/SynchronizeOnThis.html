Reports synchronization which use <b>this</b> as their lock
expression. Constructs reported include <b>synchronized</b>
blocks which lock <b>this</b>, and calls to <b>wait()</b>,
<b>notify()</b> or <b>notifyAll()</b> which target <b>wait()</b>.
Such constructs, like synchronized methods, make it hard to track just who is locking on a given
object, and make possible "denial of service" attacks on objects. As an alternative, consider
locking on a private instance variable, access to which can be completely controlled.
