Reports synchronization on <code>this</code> or <code>class</code> expressions.
Constructs reported include <code>synchronized</code> blocks, and calls to <code>wait()</code>,
<code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()</code>.
<p>
There are several reasons synchronization on this or class expressions may be a bad idea:
first, it makes synchronization part of the external interface of the class.
This makes a future change to a different locking mechanism difficult.
Second, it makes it hard to track just who is locking on a given object.
And third, it makes a denial-of-service attack possible, either on purpose or it can happen easily by accident when subclassing.

<p>As an alternative, consider
synchronizing on a <code>private final</code> lock object, access to which can be completely controlled.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public void print() {
    synchronized(this) { // warning: Lock operations on 'this' may have unforeseen side-effects
      System.out.println("synchronized");
    }
  }
  </code>
</pre>
