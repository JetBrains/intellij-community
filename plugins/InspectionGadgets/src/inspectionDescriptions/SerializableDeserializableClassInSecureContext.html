Reports classes which may be serialized or deserialized. A class
may be serialized if it supports the <b>Serializable</b> interface,
and its <b>readObject()</b> and <b>writeObject()</b> methods are not defined to always
throw an exception. Serializable classes may be dangerous in code intended for secure use.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore classes extending <b>Throwable</b> directly or indirectly.
However it may be more secure to add <b>readObject()</b> and <b>writeObject()</b> methods which always throw an exception instead.
