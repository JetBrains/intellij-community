Reports classes which may be serialized or deserialized. A class
may be serialized if it supports the <b>Serializable</b> interface,
and its <b>readObject()</b> and <b>writeObject()</b> methods are not defined to always
throw an exception. Serializable classes may be dangerous in code intended for secure use.

<p>
  Use the table below to specify what specific classes and their inheritors should be excluded
  from being checked by this inspection. This is meant for those classes which, although they inherit
  Serializable from a superclass, are not intended for serialization. Such classes would lead this
  inspection to report unnecessarily. <br>
  Note that it may be more secure to add <b>readObject()</b> and <b>writeObject()</b> methods which always throw an exception, instead.
<p>
  Use the checkbox below to ignore <b>Serializable</b> anonymous classes.
