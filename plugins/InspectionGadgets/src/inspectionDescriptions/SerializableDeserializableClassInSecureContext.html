Reports classes which may be serialized or deserialized. A class
may be serialized if it supports the <code>Serializable</code> interface,
and its <code>readObject()</code> and <code>writeObject()</code> methods are not defined to always
throw an exception. Serializable classes may be dangerous in code intended for secure use.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
  class DeserializableClass implements Serializable { // the class doesn't contain 'writeObject()' method throwing an exception
    private int sensitive = 736326;

    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) {
        throw new Error();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied the result looks like:</p>
<pre>
  class DeserializableClass implements Serializable {
    private int sensitive = 736326;

    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) {
        throw new Error();
    }

    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out) throws java.io.IOException {
        throw new java.io.NotSerializableException("DeserializableClass");
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
  Use the table below to specify what specific classes and their inheritors should be excluded
  from being checked by this inspection. This is meant for those classes which, although they inherit
  <code>Serializable</code> from a superclass, are not intended for serialization. Such classes would lead this
  inspection to report unnecessarily. <br>
  Note that it may be more secure to add <code>readObject()</code> and <code>writeObject()</code> methods
  which always throw an exception, instead.
<p>
  Use the checkbox below to ignore serializable anonymous classes.
