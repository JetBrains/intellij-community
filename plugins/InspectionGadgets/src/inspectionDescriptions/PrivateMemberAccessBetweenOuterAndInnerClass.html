Reports references from a nested class to non-constant <code>private</code> members of an outer class.
For such references, javac will generate package-private synthetic accessor methods,
which may compromise the security because members appearing to be private will in fact be accessible from the entire package.
<p>
  A nested class and its outer class are compiled to separate
  class files. The Java virtual machine normally prohibits access from a class to private fields and methods of
  another class. To enable access from a nested class to private members of an outer class, javac creates a package-private
  synthetic accessor method.
</p>
<p>
  By making the <code>private</code> member package-private instead, the actual accessibility is made explicit.
  This also saves a little bit of memory, which may improve performance in resource constrained environments.
</p>
<p>
  This inspection does not report if the language level is set to Java 11 or higher
  because thanks to nest-based access control (JEP 181), accessor methods are not generated anymore.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class Outer {
    private void x() {}

    class Inner {
      void y() {
        x();
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  class Outer {
    void x() {}

    class Inner {
      void y() {
        x();
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
