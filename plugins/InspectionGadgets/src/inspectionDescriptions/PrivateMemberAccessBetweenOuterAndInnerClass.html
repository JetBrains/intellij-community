Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports references to non-constant <b>private</b> members of a different class,
for which javac will generate a package-private synthetic accessor method.
<p>
An inner class and its containing class are compiled to separate
class files. The Java virtual machine normally prohibits access from a class to private fields and methods of
another class. To enable access from an inner class to private members of a
containing class or the other way around javac creates a package-private
synthetic accessor method. Less use of memory and greater performance may be achieved by making the
member package-private, thus allowing direct access without the creation of a synthetic accessor method.
