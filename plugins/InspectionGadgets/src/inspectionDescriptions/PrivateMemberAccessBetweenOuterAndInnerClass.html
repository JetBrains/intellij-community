This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
Reports references to non-constant <b>private</b> members of an outer class from inside an inner class or
to members of an inner class from a containing class.
<p>
An inner class and its containing class are compiled to separate
class files. The virtual machine normally prohibits access from a class to private fields and methods of
another class. To enable access from an inner class to private members of a
containing class or the other way around javac and other compilers create package private
synthetic accessor methods. Less use of memory and greater performance may be achieved by making the
member package-private, thus allowing direct access without the creation of synthetic accessor methods.
