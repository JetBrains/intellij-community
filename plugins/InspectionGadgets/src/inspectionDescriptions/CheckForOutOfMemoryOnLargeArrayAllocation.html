This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.
<p>
This inspection reports large array allocations which do not check
for <b>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</b>. In memory
constrained environments, allocations of large data objects should probably
be checked for memory depletion.
<p>
Use the field below to specify the maximum number of elements to allow in
unchecked array allocations.
