/**
 * Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
 * Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly
 * his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger,
 * those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord, when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
