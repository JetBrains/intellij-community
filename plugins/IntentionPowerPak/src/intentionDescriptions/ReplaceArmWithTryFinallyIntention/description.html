This intention replaces Automatic Resource Management
with a regular <b>try finally</b> construct. If the ARM block has no <b>catch</b> section, the entire
block is replaced. If the ARM does have a <b>catch</b> section, it is converted to a normal
<b>try catch</b> block and the <b>try finally</b> construct is placed inside.
