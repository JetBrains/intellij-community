<p>(Gradle 4.9+) Detects usage of API that interacts with tasks eagerly.</p>
<p>Eager interaction with tasks implies some inconveniences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user should manually set up all dependencies between tasks;</li>
  <li>In the <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html#sec:build_phases">configuration phase</a>,
    all the tasks accessed via the eager API become configured, even if they are not executed afterwards.
    It results in performance degradation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, the eager API will be deprecated in favor of the lazy one.</p>
<p>For a migration guide, see the
  <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/task_configuration_avoidance.html">Gradle documentation</a>.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>task foo { // reports 'task', suggests replacing it with 'task.register'
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
