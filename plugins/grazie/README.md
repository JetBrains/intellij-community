Grazie is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin providing local spell and grammar checking for Markdown, JavaDoc, Plain texts, and others.

It uses one of the leading proofreaders - [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool)
under the hood, so it supports over 15 languages and provides the best performance and 
accuracy among free (and even non-free) alternatives.

## What's inside

Grazie consists of two parts - grammar checker, backed by LanguageTool, and spellchecker backed by LanguageTool dictionaries and IDEA built-in spellcheck. When it is sensible, Grazie will use full checking pipeline (proofreading and spellchecking), but in some cases (e.g., in code) it will use just spellcheck.

Grazie supports (including dialects):
* English (British, American, Canadian)
* Russian
* Persian
* French
* German (Germany, Austrian)
* Polish
* Italian
* Dutch
* Portuguese (Brazilian, Portugal)
* Chinese
* Greek
* Japanese
* Romanian
* Slovak
* Spanish
* Ukrainian
