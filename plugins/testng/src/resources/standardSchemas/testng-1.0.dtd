<!--

Here is a quick overview of the main parts of this DTD.  For more information,
refer to the <a href="http://testng.org">main web site</a>.

A <b>suite</b> is made of <b>tests</b> and <b>parameters</b>.

A <b>test</b> is made of three parts:

<ul>
<li> <b>parameters</b>, which override the suite parameters
<li> <b>groups</b>, made of two parts
<li> <b>classes</b>, defining which classes are going to be part
  of this test run
</ul>

In turn, <b>groups</b> are made of two parts:
<ul>
<li> Definitions, which allow you to group groups into
  bigger groups
<li> Runs, which defines the groups that the methods
  must belong to in order to be run during this test
</ul>

<!-- A suite is the top-level element of a testng.xml file                  -->
<!ELEMENT suite (groups?,(listeners|packages|test|parameter|method-selectors|suite-files)*) >

<!-- Attributes: -->
<!--
@attr  name        The name of this suite (as it will appear in the reports)
@attr  junit       Whether to run in JUnit mode.
@attr  verbose     How verbose the output on the console will be.
                This setting has no impact on the HTML reports.
@attr  parallel   Whether TestNG should use different threads
                to run your tests (might speed up the process)
                Do not use "true" and "false" values, they are now deprecated.
@attr  parent-module A module used to create the parent injector of all guice injectors used
       in tests of the suite
@attr  guice-stage The stage with which the parent injector is created
@attr  configfailurepolicy  Whether to continue attempting Before/After
                Class/Methods after they've failed once or just skip remaining.
@attr  thread-count An integer giving the size of the thread pool to use
                if you set parallel.
@attr  annotations  If "javadoc", TestNG will look for
                JavaDoc annotations in your sources, otherwise it will
                use JDK5 annotations.
@attr  time-out     The time to wait in milliseconds before aborting the
                method (if parallel="methods") or the test (parallel="tests")
@attr  skipfailedinvocationcounts Whether to skip failed invocations.
@attr  data-provider-thread-count An integer giving the size of the thread pool to use
       for parallel data providers.
@attr  object-factory A class that implements IObjectFactory that will be used to
       instantiate the test objects.
@attr allow-return-values If true, tests that return a value will be run as well

<!--
@attr  name         The name of this test (as it will appear in the reports)
@attr  junit        Whether to run in JUnit mode.
@attr  verbose      How verbose the output on the console will be.
                This setting has no impact on the HTML reports.
                Default value: suite level verbose.
@attr  parallel     Whether TestNG should use different threads
                to run your tests (might speed up the process)
                Do not use "true" and "false" values, they are now deprecated.
@attr  thread-count An integer giving the size of the thread pool to be used if
                parallel mode is used. Overrides the suite level value.
@attr  annotations  If "javadoc", TestNG will look for
                JavaDoc annotations in your sources, otherwise it will
                use JDK5 annotations.

                the method (if parallel="methods") or the test (if parallel="tests")
@attr  enabled      flag to enable/disable current test. Default value: true
@attr  skipfailedinvocationcounts Whether to skip failed invocations.
@attr preserve-order If true, the classes in this tag will be run in the same order as
found in the XML file.
@attr allow-return-values If true, tests that return a value will be run as well
