<body>
<p>
  Reports the name of an element or an attribute that is used in an XPath-expression but is missing in the associated XML file and is not defined in the referenced schema. This prevents problems caused by typos in
  XPath-expressions that otherwise occur when running the script and may even happen not to be recognized immediately.
</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>
  <code>&lt;xsl:template match="<b>h:txtarea</b>" /></code>
</p>

<p>
  If the <code>h</code> is bound to the XHTML namespace, the inspection will report this part of the <code>match</code> expression as an
  unknown element name because the correct name of the element is "textarea".
