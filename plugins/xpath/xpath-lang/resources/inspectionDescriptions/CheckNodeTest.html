<html>
<body>
Reports names of elements or attributes that are used in an XPath-expression but are missing in the associated XML files and are not
defined in the referenced schemas.
Such names are often the result of typos and would otherwise probably only be discovered at runtime.

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  &lt;xsl:template match="<b>h:txtarea</b>" />
</code></pre>

<p>
  If the <code>h</code> is bound to the XHTML namespace, the inspection will report this part of the <code>match</code> expression as an
  unknown element name because the correct name of the element is "textarea".
