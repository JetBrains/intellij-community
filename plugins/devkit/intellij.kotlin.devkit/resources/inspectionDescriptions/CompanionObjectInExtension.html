Reports companion objects' usage in extensions.
<p>
  Extensions must not have a companion object, this usually results in excessive classloading
  or early initialization of heavy resources (TokenSets, Regexes, etc.) when the extension class is loaded.

  Top-level declarations or objects should be used instead of companion objects in extensions.
