Reports incorrect companion objects' usage in extensions.
<p>
  Companion objects in extensions can only contain a logger and constants, other declarations
  may cause excessive classloading or early initialization of heavy resources (TokenSets, Regexes, etc.)
  when the extension class is loaded.

  Instead of being stored in companion objects, these declarations must be stored in an object or be top-level.
