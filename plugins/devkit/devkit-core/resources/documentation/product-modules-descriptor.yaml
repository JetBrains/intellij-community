                          Defines how the module should be processed:
                          - `required` - module with all its dependencies is added to the main module group.
                            If some of its dependencies aren't available in the module repository, the product fails to start.
                          - `optional` - module with all its dependencies is added to the main module group if all of its dependencies are available, otherwise it's skipped.
                          - `on-demand` - module is used by some plugins only, but it isn't included in the plugin's layout, so it needs to be added to the main module group.
                            In the current implementation, `on-demand` modules are treated the same way as `required`, but in the future they will be loaded only if other modules which depend on them are loaded.

              The main module must contain <path>META-INF/plugin.xml</path> describing a plugin in [v2](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/IJPL-A-31) format.
              Additional modules defined in the `<content>` element are added to the plugin module group.
