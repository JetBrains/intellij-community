Reports incorrect registration of plugin components
(Components and Actions) both in code and in the <code>plugin.xml</code> descriptor.
<p>
  The following problems are reported:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Component implementation-class is not assignable to its interface-class (<code>plugin.xml</code>)</li>
  <li>Incorrect component registration, e.g. <code>ProjectComponent</code> is registered as Application Component,
    or the class doesn't implement any component interface at all (<code>plugin.xml</code> and Java code)
  </li>
  <li>Incorrect class modifiers: Action classes must be <code>public</code> and must have a public
    no-argument constructor. Additionally, Action and Component implementation classes
    must not be abstract (<code>plugin.xml</code> and Java code)
  </li>
  <li>Duplicate interface-class: A class may only be used once as interface-class (<code>plugin.xml</code>)</li>
</ul>
