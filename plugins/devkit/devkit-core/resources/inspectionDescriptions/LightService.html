Reports the following light service problems:
<ul>
  <li>A class annotated with the <code>@com.intellij.openapi.components.Service</code> annotation is not final.
  </li>
  <li>A service having a constructor that takes a <code>com.intellij.openapi.project.Project</code> parameter is
    not annotated as project-level service.
  </li>
  <li>A service annotated as an application-level service does not have a no-arg constructor, nor a constructor that
    takes<code>kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope</code>.
  </li>
  <li>Mismatch in retrieving a service: getting a project-level service as an application-level service and vice versa.
  </li>
</ul>
