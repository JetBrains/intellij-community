Reports usages of IntelliJ API that were introduced in a version newer than "since" build specified in the plugin.
It may lead to incompatibilities of the plugin with older IDE builds.

<p>
  To avoid possible issues when running the plugin in older IDEs, it may be necessary to increase "since" constraint of the plugin,
  or avoid using the APIs.
