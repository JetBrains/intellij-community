Reports usages of IntelliJ API that were introduced in a version newer than "since-build" specified in the <code>plugin.xml</code>.
It may lead to incompatibilities of the plugin with older IDE builds.

<p>
  To avoid possible issues when running the plugin in older IDEs, it may be necessary to increase "since-build" constraint of the plugin,
  alternatively avoid using the APIs.
