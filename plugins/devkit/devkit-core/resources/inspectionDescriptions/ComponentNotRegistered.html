This inspection detects plugin components and actions that are not (yet) registered in a plugin.xml
descriptor and offers a QuickFix to register the component. This eases developing new components when
making use of the "Create Class" intention and helps to keep track of potentially obsolete
components.
<p>
    There's an option to turn off the check for Actions as they may be intentionally created and
    registered dynamically. Note that the inspection can also be suppressed on a per-class level,
    so it normally shouldn't be necessary to switch off the inspection completely. Especially
    because the inspection ignores abstract classes and by default non-public classes as well.
