Checks that all content modules registered in a plugin descriptor have dedicated IntelliJ IDEA modules.
<p>
  The way to register a content module using <code>moduleName/subDescriptorName</code> syntax without extracting a separate IntelliJ IDEA
  module for it is deprecated now.
  Each content module should have its own IntelliJ IDEA module to allow checking that dependencies used during compilation are available
  at runtime.
