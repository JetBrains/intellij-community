Reports usage of standard Java I/O operations that may work inefficiently in a remote Eel environment.

<p>
  When working with remote development, standard Java I/O operations like Files.readAllBytes() can be inefficient
  due to network communication overhead. This inspection suggests using optimized Eel API alternatives that are designed
  specifically for remote development scenarios.

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
// Inefficient for remote development:
byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(path);

// Optimized Eel API:
byte[] data = EelFiles.readAllBytes(path);
</code></pre>
