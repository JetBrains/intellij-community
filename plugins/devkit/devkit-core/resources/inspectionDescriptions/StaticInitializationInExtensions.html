Reports static initialization in <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-extensions.html">IDE extensions</a>.
<p>
  Static initialization is performed once the class is loaded, which may cause excessive classloading or early initialization of heavy resources.
  Since IDE extensions are supposed to be cheap to create, they must not have static initializers.
