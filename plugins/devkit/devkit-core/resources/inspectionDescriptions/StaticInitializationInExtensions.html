Reports static initialization in <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-extensions.html">extension point implementations</a>.
<p>
  Static initialization is performed once the class is loaded, which may cause excessive classloading or early initialization of heavy resources.
  Since extension point implementations are supposed to be cheap to create, they must not have static initializers.
