Reports about calls to methods annotated with <code>@CheckReturnValue</code>, whose result is not checked.
<p>
  <code>@CheckReturnValue</code> can be used by methods that may fail but don't throw an exception.
  If the returned error is not checked, the caller may not be aware of the failure.
</p>
<p>
  It is a valid case when it is not necessary if some call succeeded or failed.
  Nevertheless, it's a rare case, and it's better to ignore the inspection in such cases explicitly.
