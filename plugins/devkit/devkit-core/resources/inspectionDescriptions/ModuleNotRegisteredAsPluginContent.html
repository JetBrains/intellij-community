Reports modules not registered as a content module in any plugin descriptor.
<p>
  The inspection fix tries to determine where the module can be declared.
  It visits parent directories of the current module and tries to find a module containing resources root with <code>META-INF/plugin.xml</code> file.
  The found <code>plugin.xml</code> must have a valid ID.
