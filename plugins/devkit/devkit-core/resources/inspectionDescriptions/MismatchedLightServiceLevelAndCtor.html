Reports mismatches between light service levels and constructors.
<p>The following problems are reported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A light service class has a constructor with one parameter of type <code>com.intellij.openapi.project.Project</code> is
    not annotated as project-level service.
  </li>
  <li>A light service class annotated as an application-level service does not have a no-arg constructor, nor a constructor with one
    parameter of type <code>kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
