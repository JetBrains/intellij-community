Reports incorrect usage of path annotations.

<p>
  This inspection detects cases where a string annotated with one path annotation is used in a context that expects a string with a different path annotation.
  It helps ensure proper usage of <code>@MultiRoutingFileSystemPath</code> and <code>@NativePath</code> annotations.
</p>

<p>The inspection highlights the following issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a string annotated with <code>@NativePath</code> is used in a Path constructor or factory method</li>
  <li>When a string annotated with <code>@NativePath</code> is passed to a method parameter annotated with <code>@MultiRoutingFileSystemPath</code></li>
  <li>When a string annotated with <code>@MultiRoutingFileSystemPath</code> is passed to a method parameter annotated with <code>@NativePath</code></li>
  <li>When a string literal is used in a context that expects either annotation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Quick fixes are provided to add the appropriate annotation where needed.

<p>
  This inspection helps prevent runtime errors that can occur when paths with different formats are used incorrectly.
  The <code>@MultiRoutingFileSystemPath</code> annotation is used for paths that should work across different file systems,
  while the <code>@NativePath</code> annotation is used for paths that are specific to the native file system.
