Reports components which do not have any static
text and do not have any label which is marked with <b><font color="#000080">setLabelFor</font></b>
for this component. Components which do not have static text include edit fields and combo boxes.
Such components cannot be activated with a keyboard shortcut. The quickfix for this inspection
allows to automatically associate an adjacent label with the problematic component.
