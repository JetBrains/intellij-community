### README.md strings

readme.welcome.header=Meet the Interactive Feature Trainer
readme.ift.description=This interactive course will guide you through a lot of IDE workflows and use cases. It comes with many helpful \
  action shortcuts. You don''t need to memorize all of them. Instead, try them and take into your service the most useful ones. \
  Since during your everyday work, you might encounter new problems, revisit this course and give other features a second try. \
  Stay tuned for new lessons helping you to be more productive with {0}.
readme.usage.header=How to use the course
readme.toolwindow.description=The `{0}` tool window contains several modules with the corresponding sets of lessons that you can take \
  in any order. When you finish studying a lesson, it will be marked as completed. You can use a completed lesson for your reference \
  or restart it if you want to refresh your knowledge.
readme.experienced.users.remark=Even though a lesson looks familiar to you, give it a try: you may discover helpful examples and unknown \
  shortcuts of the features you actively use!
readme.start.header=Get started
readme.indexing.description=You are likely reading this `README.md` during the learning project initialization. Usually, `indexing` is the \
  most time-consuming operation during project initialization. The IDE will need to collect information about your environment, project\
  {0,choice,1#, libraries|2#}, and construct internal representation. It is needed for fast navigation and search.
readme.navigation.hint=The `{0}` module in this course will show how to use it.
readme.shortcuts.header=Manage shortcuts
readme.shortcuts.problem.description=Some shortcuts in this course may conflict with the system or other application shortcuts. \
  In this case, you can click the problematic shortcut in the text of the lesson. The opened popup will show you the action name and \
  alternative shortcuts. You will be able to apply the action or assign a new shortcut.
readme.bug.tracker.remark=If there is another issue, try to restart the lesson or report the bug in [our bug tracker]({0}).
readme.conclusion.header=Get back to your project
readme.exit.options=To return to the welcome screen, just close the project window. Alternatively, you can select `{0} | {1}` from \
  the main menu. Also, you can use the `{0}` menu to open or create new projects. By default, the `{2}` tool window is hidden. \
  You can open it by selecting `{3} | {4}` from the main menu.
readme.feedback.request=We will appreciate you leaving your feedback about this learning course!
