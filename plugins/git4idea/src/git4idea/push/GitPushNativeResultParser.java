/**
 * Parses the output received from git push and returns a result.
 * NB: It is assumed that only one ref is pushed => there is only one result in the output.
 *
 * Output format described by git-push man:
 * <pre>
 * The status of the push is output in tabular form, with each line representing the status of a single ref.
 * If --porcelain is used, then each line of the output is of the form:
 *
 *             &lt;flag&gt; \t &lt;from&gt;:&lt;to&gt; \t &lt;summary&gt; (&lt;reason&gt;)
 *
 * The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if --porcelain or --verbose option is used.
 *
 * flag
 *     A single character indicating the status of the ref:
 *     (space)
 *         for a successfully pushed fast-forward;
 *     +
 *         for a successful forced update;
 *     -
 *         for a successfully deleted ref;
 *     *
 *         for a successfully pushed new ref;
 *     !
 *         for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and
 *     =
 *         for a ref that was up to date and did not need pushing.
 *
 * summary
 *     For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and new values of the ref in a form
 *     suitable for using as an argument to git log (this is <old>..<new> in most cases, and
 *     <old>...<new> for forced non-fast-forward updates).
 *
 *     For a failed update, more details are given:
 * rejected
 *     Git did not try to send the ref at all, typically because it is not a fast-forward and you
 *     did not force the update.
 *
 * remote rejected
 *     The remote end refused the update. Usually caused by a hook on the remote side, or because
 *     the remote repository has one of the following safety options in effect:
 *     receive.denyCurrentBranch (for pushes to the checked out branch), receive.denyNonFastForwards
 *     (for forced non-fast-forward updates), receive.denyDeletes or receive.denyDeleteCurrent. See
 *     git-config(1).
 *
 * remote failure
 *     The remote end did not report the successful update of the ref, perhaps because of a
 *     temporary error on the remote side, a break in the network connection, or other transient
 *     error.
 *
 * from
 *     The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its refs/<type>/ prefix. In the case of deletion,
 *     the name of the local ref is omitted.
 *
 * to
 *     The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its refs/<type>/ prefix.
 *
 * reason
 *     A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully pushed refs, no explanation is needed.
 *     For a failed ref, the reason for failure is described.
 * </pre>
