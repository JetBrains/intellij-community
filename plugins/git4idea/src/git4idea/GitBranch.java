/**
 * <p>Represents a Git branch, local or remote.</p>
 *
 * <p>Local and remote branches are different in that nature, that remote branch has complex name ("origin/master") containing both
 *    the name of the remote and the name of the branch. And while the standard name of the remote branch if origin/master,
 *    in certain cases we must operate with the name which the branch has at the remote: "master".</p>
 *
 * <p>It contains information about the branch name and the hash it points to.
 *    Note that the object (including the hash) is immutable. That means that if branch reference move along, you have to get new instance
 *    of the GitBranch object, probably from {@link GitRepository#getBranches()} or {@link git4idea.repo.GitRepository#getCurrentBranch()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>GitBranches are equal, if their full names are equal. That means that if two GitBranch objects have different hashes, they
 *    are considered equal. But in this case an error if logged, becase it means that one of this GitBranch instances is out-of-date, and
 *    it is required to use an {@link GitRepository#update(TrackedTopic...) updated} version.</p>
