/**
 * A read-only view of the contents of the terminal screen and history buffer.
 *
 * An output model can be thought of as a text string that contains the currently displayed text
 * and some previous history, that is removed ("trimmed") from time to time to avoid consuming too much memory.
 * The model keeps track of how many characters were trimmed and provides "absolute" offsets
 * (from the very beginning). The currently available "window" has the length [textLength] and is located between [startOffset] and [endOffset] (exclusive).
 *
 * In addition to offset-based indexing, logical line-based indexing is also available.
 * A logical line in this context is a line of process output that may correspond to several visual lines in the terminal
 * in the case when it was wrapped because it was too long to fit into the terminal.
 * Available logical line indexes are between [firstLineIndex] and [lastLineIndex] (inclusive).
 *
 * Normally trimming works in such a way that [startOffset] keeps increasing steadily, reflecting the removal of text chunks at the start.
 * However, there can be exceptions to this behavior. For example, when the whole buffer is cleared, the offsets may be reset to zero.
 * In remote development scenarios, when the frontend reconnects to the backend and the state is reset
 * to whatever state the backend model had at the moment when the frontend connected.
 *
 * The interface provides a read-only view, but the model itself is mutable and therefore should only be accessed on the mutating thread,
 * which is currently the EDT. Model listeners (see [addListener]) are synchronous and therefore the model can be safely accessed from listeners.
 * If background access is needed (for example, for some CPU-intensive processing), it's possible to take a snapshot using [takeSnapshot].
 *
 * In most environments, a running terminal session provides two models: one for the main buffer and one for the alternate buffer
 * (used to run "fullscreen" apps like Vim). The currently active model may be retrieved from the data context using the [DATA_KEY] key.
