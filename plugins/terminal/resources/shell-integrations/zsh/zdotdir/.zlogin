# See doc in .zshenv for how IntelliJ injects itself into Zsh startup process.

# Actually, this file is not expected to be be read, as ZDOTDIR is restored to its
# original value in the IntelliJ's .zshrc and IntelliJ always starts Zsh in an interactive
# mode, a behavior that, according to the documentation, cannot be modified afterward:
#
# INTERACTIVE shell state option (https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options.html)
#  "The value of this option can only be changed via flags supplied at invocation of
#  the shell. It cannot be changed once zsh is running."
#
# However, just in case, let's take a safety net and proxy .zlogin.
