          This inspection reports any fields which are not used in the toString() method of the class. This can be useful to discover
          fields that were added after the toString() method was created and for which the toString() method was not correctly adjusted.
          It is possible to exclude fields from this check in the settings accessible via the Generate > toString() dialog.
            <p>
            This inspection will also check for problems with getter methods if 'enable getters in code generation' is enabled
            in settings.
