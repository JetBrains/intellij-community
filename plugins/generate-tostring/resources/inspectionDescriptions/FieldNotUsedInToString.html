            This insepction is used to identify out of synchronization situations
            where you have an existing toString() method that dumps the fields. However some fields have been added to the class
            later and these new fields are not dumped in the toString() method.
            <p>
            This inspection will also check for problems with getter methods if 'enable getters in code generation' is enabled
            in settings.
            <p>
            This inspection can use on-the-fly code inspection by enabling it to show errors as warnings. This will highlight
            any unused fields on-the-fly in the java editor - also the right gutter will indicate the location of the error using
            a yellow marker. This is the same feature as the build in inspection <font color="#000080">'Field XXX is never assigned'</font>.
            <p>
            <font color="#000080"><b>Notice</b> 'on-the-fly' should be enabled from the settings to this plugin.</font>
