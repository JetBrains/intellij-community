    Special case [1]:

      The situation is:
        - parent-A:     file exists,
        - parent-B:     no file,
        - working-copy: no file.

      Detecting a "deletion" will depend on the presence of actual change on
      the "parent-A" branch:

      Subcase 🄱 or 🄶 : if the state of the file in "parent-A" is unchanged
      compared to the merge ancestors, then parent-A branch left the file
      untouched while parent-B deleted it. We simply apply the change from
      "parent-B" branch the file was automatically dropped.
      The result is:
          - file is not recorded as touched by the merge.

      Subcase 🄲 or 🄷 : otherwise, the change from parent-A branch were explicitly dropped and
      the file was "deleted again". From a user perspective, the message
      about "locally changed" while "remotely deleted" (or the other way
      around) was issued and the user chose to deleted the file.
      The result:
          - file is recorded as touched by the merge.


    Special case [2]:

      The situation is:
        - parent-A:     no file,
        - parent-B:     file,
        - working-copy: file (same content as parent-B).

      There are three subcases depending on the ancestors contents:

      - A) the file is missing in all ancestors,
      - B) at least one ancestor has the file with filenode ≠ from parent-B,
      - C) all ancestors use the same filenode as parent-B,

      Subcase (A) is the simpler, nothing happend on parent-A side while
      parent-B added it.

        The result:
            - the file is not marked as touched by the merge.

      Subcase (B) is the counter part of "Special case [1]", the file was
        modified on parent-B side, while parent-A side deleted it. However this
        time, the conflict was solved by keeping the file (and its
        modification). We consider the file as "salvaged".

        The result:
            - the file is marked as "salvaged" by the merge.

      Subcase (C) is subtle variation of the case above. In this case, the
        file in unchanged on the parent-B side and actively removed on the
        parent-A side. So the merge machinery correctly decide it should be
        removed. However, the file was explicitly restored to its parent-B
        content before the merge was commited. The file is be marked
        as salvaged too. From the merge result perspective, this is similar to
        Subcase (B), however from the merge resolution perspective they differ
        since in (C), there was some conflict not obvious solution to the
        merge (That got reversed)

    Special case [3]:

      The situation is:
        - parent-A:     file,
        - parent-B:     file (different filenode as parent-A),
        - working-copy: file (same filenode as parent-B).

      This case is in theory much simple, for this to happens, this mean the
      filenode in parent-A is purely replacing the one in parent-B (either a
      descendant, or a full new file history, see changeset). So the merge
      introduce no changes, and the file is not affected by the merge...

      However, in the wild it is possible to find commit with the above is not
      True. For example repository have some commit where the *new* node is an
      ancestor of the node in parent-A, or where parent-A and parent-B are two
      branches of the same file history, yet not merge-filenode were created
      (while the "merge" should have led to a "modification").

      Detecting such cases (and not recording the file as modified) would be a
      nice bonus. However do not any of this yet.

    When a file is removed relative to p1 in a merge, this

    itself deletes the file. We decide this by doing a
    simplified three way merge of the manifest entry for
    the file. There are two ways we decide the merge
    itself didn't delete a file:
    - neither parent (nor the merge) contain the file
    - exactly one parent contains the file, and that
      parent has the same filelog entry as the merge
      ancestor (or all of them if there two). In other
      words, that parent left the file unchanged while the
      other one deleted it.
    One way to think about this is that deleting a file is
    similar to emptying it, so the list of changed files
    should be similar either way. The computation
    described above is not done directly in _filecommit
    when creating the list of changed files, however
