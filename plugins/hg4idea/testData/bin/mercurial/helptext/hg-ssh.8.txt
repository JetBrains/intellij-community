Synopsis
""""""""
**hg-ssh** repositories...

Description
"""""""""""
**hg-ssh** is a wrapper for ssh access to a limited set of mercurial repos.

To be used in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with the "command" option, see sshd(8):
command="hg-ssh path/to/repo1 /path/to/repo2 ~/repo3 ~user/repo4" ssh-dss ...
(probably together with these other useful options:
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding)

This allows pull/push over ssh from/to the repositories given as arguments.

If all your repositories are subdirectories of a common directory, you can
allow shorter paths with:
command="cd path/to/my/repositories && hg-ssh repo1 subdir/repo2"

You can use pattern matching of your normal shell, e.g.:
command="cd repos && hg-ssh user/thomas/* projects/{mercurial,foo}"

You can also add a --read-only flag to allow read-only access to a key, e.g.:
command="hg-ssh --read-only repos/\*"
