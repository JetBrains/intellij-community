Files
"""""

``/etc/mercurial/hgrc``, ``$HOME/.hgrc``, ``.hg/hgrc``
    This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in
    ``.hg/hgrc`` override those in ``$HOME/.hgrc``, and these override
    settings made in the global ``/etc/mercurial/hgrc`` configuration.
    See |hgrc(5)|_ for details of the contents and format of these
    files.

``.hgignore``
    This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that
    describe file names that should be ignored by **hg**. For details,
    see |hgignore(5)|_.

``.hgsub``
    This file defines the locations of all subrepositories, and
    tells where the subrepository checkouts came from. For details, see
    :hg:`help subrepos`.

``.hgsubstate``
    This file is where Mercurial stores all nested repository states. *NB: This
    file should not be edited manually.*

``.hgtags``
    This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one
    of each separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of
    the repository contents. The file content is encoded using UTF-8.

``.hg/last-message.txt``
    This file is used by :hg:`commit` to store a backup of the commit message
    in case the commit fails.

``.hg/localtags``
    This file can be used to define local tags which are not shared among
    repositories. The file format is the same as for ``.hgtags``, but it is
    encoded using the local system encoding.

Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in ``.orig``,
if the ``.orig`` file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial,
it will be overwritten.

Bugs
""""
Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list (see Resources_
below) when you find them.
