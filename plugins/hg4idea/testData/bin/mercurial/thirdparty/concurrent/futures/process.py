Executor.submit() called:
- creates a uniquely numbered _WorkItem and adds it to the "Work Items" dict
- adds the id of the _WorkItem to the "Work Ids" queue

Local worker thread:
- reads work ids from the "Work Ids" queue and looks up the corresponding
  WorkItem from the "Work Items" dict: if the work item has been cancelled then
  it is simply removed from the dict, otherwise it is repackaged as a
  _CallItem and put in the "Call Q". New _CallItems are put in the "Call Q"
  until "Call Q" is full. NOTE: the size of the "Call Q" is kept small because
  calls placed in the "Call Q" can no longer be cancelled with Future.cancel().
- reads _ResultItems from "Result Q", updates the future stored in the
  "Work Items" dict and deletes the dict entry

Process #1..n:
- reads _CallItems from "Call Q", executes the calls, and puts the resulting
  _ResultItems in "Request Q"

# Workers are created as daemon threads and processes. This is done to allow the
# interpreter to exit when there are still idle processes in a
# ProcessPoolExecutor's process pool (i.e. shutdown() was not called). However,
# allowing workers to die with the interpreter has two undesirable properties:
#   - The workers would still be running during interpretor shutdown,
#     meaning that they would fail in unpredictable ways.
#   - The workers could be killed while evaluating a work item, which could
#     be bad if the callable being evaluated has external side-effects e.g.
#     writing to a file.
#
# To work around this problem, an exit handler is installed which tells the
# workers to exit when their work queues are empty and then waits until the
# threads/processes finish.
