### obsolescence marker flag

## bumpedfix flag
#
# When a changeset A' succeed to a changeset A which became public, we call A'
# "bumped" because it's a successors of a public changesets
#
# o    A' (bumped)
# |`:
# | o  A
# |/
# o    Z
#
# The way to solve this situation is to create a new changeset Ad as children
# of A. This changeset have the same content than A'. So the diff from A to A'
# is the same than the diff from A to Ad. Ad is marked as a successors of A'
#
# o   Ad
# |`:
# | x A'
# |'|
# o | A
# |/
# o Z
#
# But by transitivity Ad is also a successors of A. To avoid having Ad marked
# as bumped too, we add the `bumpedfix` flag to the marker. <A', (Ad,)>.
# This flag mean that the successors express the changes between the public and
# bumped version and fix the situation, breaking the transitivity of
# "bumped" here.

    locally-known successors outside of <nodes> are ignored (since their
    precursors markers are also relevant to these successors).

    For example:

    An example usage is strip. When stripping a changeset, we also want to
    strip the markers exclusive to this changeset. Otherwise we would have
    "dangling"" obsolescence markers from its precursors: Obsolescence markers
    marking a node as obsolete without any successors available locally.

    As for relevant markers, the prune markers for children will be followed.
    Of course, they will only be followed if the pruned children is
    locally-known. Since the prune markers are relevant to the pruned node.
    However, while prune markers are considered relevant to the parent of the
    pruned changesets, prune markers for locally-known changeset (with no
    successors) are considered exclusive to the pruned nodes. This allows
    to strip the prune markers (with the rest of the exclusive chain) alongside
    the pruned changesets.

    The successors set of a changeset A are the group of revisions that succeed
    A. It succeeds A as a consistent whole, each revision being only a partial
    replacement. By default, the successors set contains non-obsolete
    changesets only, walking the obsolescence graph until reaching a leaf. If
    'closest' is set to True, closest successors-sets are return (the
    obsolescence walk stops on known changesets).

    This function returns the full list of successor sets which is why it
    returns a list of tuples and not just a single tuple. Each tuple is a valid
    successors set. Note that (A,) may be a valid successors set for changeset A
    (see below).

    In most cases, a changeset A will have a single element (e.g. the changeset
    A is replaced by A') in its successors set. Though, it is also common for a
    changeset A to have no elements in its successor set (e.g. the changeset
    has been pruned). Therefore, the returned list of successors sets will be
    [(A',)] or [], respectively.

    When a changeset A is split into A' and B', however, it will result in a
    successors set containing more than a single element, i.e. [(A',B')].
    Divergent changesets will result in multiple successors sets, i.e. [(A',),
    (A'')].

    If a changeset A is not obsolete, then it will conceptually have no
    successors set. To distinguish this from a pruned changeset, the successor
    set will contain itself only, i.e. [(A,)].

    Finally, final successors unknown locally are considered to be pruned
    (pruned: obsoleted without any successors). (Final: successors not affected
    by markers).

    The 'closest' mode respect the repoview filtering. For example, without
    filter it will stop at the first locally known changeset, with 'visible'
    filter it will stop on visible changesets).

    The optional `cache` parameter is a dictionary that may contains
    precomputed successors sets. It is meant to reuse the computation of a
    previous call to `successorssets` when multiple calls are made at the same
    time. The cache dictionary is updated in place. The caller is responsible
    for its life span. Code that makes multiple calls to `successorssets`
    *should* use this cache mechanism or risk a performance hit.

    Since results are different depending of the 'closest' most, the same cache
    cannot be reused for both mode.
