    This computes parent-child relations in the sub graph filtered by
    a revset. Primary use case is to draw a revisions graph.

    In the following example, we consider that the node 'f' has edges to all
    ancestor nodes, but redundant paths are eliminated. The edge 'f'->'b'
    is eliminated because there is a path 'f'->'c'->'b' for example.

          - d - e -
         /         \
        a - b - c - f

    If the node 'c' is filtered out, the edge 'f'->'b' is activated.

          - d - e -
         /         \
        a - b -(c)- f

    Likewise, if 'd' and 'e' are filtered out, this edge is fully eliminated

           (d) (e)

        a - b - c - f

    Implementation-wise, 'f' is passed down to 'a' as unresolved through the
    'f'->'e'->'d'->'a' path, whereas we do also remember that 'f' has already
    been resolved while walking down the 'f'->'c'->'b'->'a' path. When
    processing the node 'a', the unresolved 'f'->'a' path is eliminated as
    the 'f' end is marked as resolved.

    Ancestors are searched from the tipmost revision in the subset so the
    results can be cached. You should specify startrev to narrow the search
    space to ':startrev'.

    ### Quick summary of the algorithm
    #
    # This function is based around a "retention" principle. We keep revisions
    # in memory until we are ready to emit a whole branch that immediately
    # "merges" into an existing one. This reduces the number of parallel
    # branches with interleaved revisions.
    #
    # During iteration revs are split into two groups:
    # A) revision already emitted
    # B) revision in "retention". They are stored as different subgroups.
    #
    # for each REV, we do the following logic:
    #
    #   1) if REV is a parent of (A), we will emit it. If there is a
    #   retention group ((B) above) that is blocked on REV being
    #   available, we emit all the revisions out of that retention
    #   group first.
    #
    #   2) else, we'll search for a subgroup in (B) awaiting for REV to be
    #   available, if such subgroup exist, we add REV to it and the subgroup is
    #   now awaiting for REV.parents() to be available.
    #
    #   3) finally if no such group existed in (B), we create a new subgroup.
    #
    #
    # To bootstrap the algorithm, we emit the tipmost revision (which
    # puts it in group (A) from above).

    revs.sort(reverse=True)

    # Set of parents of revision that have been emitted. They can be considered
    # unblocked as the graph generator is already aware of them so there is no
    # need to delay the revisions that reference them.
    #
    # If someone wants to prioritize a branch over the others, pre-filling this
    # set will force all other branches to wait until this branch is ready to be
    # emitted.
    unblocked = set(firstbranch)

    # list of groups waiting to be displayed, each group is defined by:
    #
    #   (revs:    lists of revs waiting to be displayed,
    #    blocked: set of that cannot be displayed before those in 'revs')
    #
    # The second value ('blocked') correspond to parents of any revision in the
    # group ('revs') that is not itself contained in the group. The main idea
    # of this algorithm is to delay as much as possible the emission of any
    # revision.  This means waiting for the moment we are about to display
    # these parents to display the revs in a group.
    #
    # This first implementation is smart until it encounters a merge: it will
    # emit revs as soon as any parent is about to be emitted and can grow an
    # arbitrary number of revs in 'blocked'. In practice this mean we properly
    # retains new branches but gives up on any special ordering for ancestors
    # of merges. The implementation can be improved to handle this better.
    #
    # The first subgroup is special. It corresponds to all the revision that
    # were already emitted. The 'revs' lists is expected to be empty and the
    # 'blocked' set contains the parents revisions of already emitted revision.
