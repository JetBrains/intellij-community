        a single HTTP request. While some peers may support multiple command
        sends over the wire per executor, consumers need to code to the least
        capable peer. So it should be assumed that command executors buffer
        called commands until they are told to send them and that each

        node's parents are emitted before the node itself. Transitively, this
        means that a node may only be emitted once all its ancestors in
        ``nodes`` have also been emitted.

        By default, emits "index" data (the ``node``, ``p1node``, and
        ``p2node`` attributes). If ``revisiondata`` is set, revision data
        will also be present on the emitted objects.

        With default argument values, implementations can choose to emit
        either fulltext revision data or a delta. When emitting deltas,
        implementations must consider whether the delta's base revision
        fulltext is available to the receiver.

        The base revision fulltext is guaranteed to be available if any of
        the following are met:

        * Its fulltext revision was emitted by this method call.
        * A delta for that revision was emitted by this method call.
        * ``assumehaveparentrevisions`` is True and the base revision is a
          parent of the node.

        ``nodesorder`` can be used to control the order that revisions are
        emitted. By default, revisions can be reordered as long as they are
        in DAG topological order (see above). If the value is ``nodes``,
        the iteration order from ``nodes`` should be used. If the value is
        ``storage``, then the native order from the backing storage layer
        is used. (Not all storage layers will have strong ordering and behavior
        of this mode is storage-dependent.) ``nodes`` ordering can force
        revisions to be emitted before their ancestors, so consumers should
        use it with care.

        The ``linknode`` attribute on the returned ``irevisiondelta`` may not
        be set and it is the caller's responsibility to resolve it, if needed.

        If ``deltamode`` is CG_DELTAMODE_PREV and revision data is requested,
        all revision data should be emitted as deltas against the revision
        emitted just prior. The initial revision should be a delta against its
        1st parent.

):
    """Complete interface for a local repository."""


class iwireprotocolcommandcacher(interfaceutil.Interface):
    """Represents a caching backend for wire protocol commands.

    Wire protocol version 2 supports transparent caching of many commands.
    To leverage this caching, servers can activate objects that cache
    command responses. Objects handle both cache writing and reading.
    This interface defines how that response caching mechanism works.

    Wire protocol version 2 commands emit a series of objects that are
    serialized and sent to the client. The caching layer exists between
    the invocation of the command function and the sending of its output
    objects to an output layer.

    Instances of this interface represent a binding to a cache that
    can serve a response (in place of calling a command function) and/or
    write responses to a cache for subsequent use.

    When a command request arrives, the following happens with regards
    to this interface:

    1. The server determines whether the command request is cacheable.
    2. If it is, an instance of this interface is spawned.
    3. The cacher is activated in a context manager (``__enter__`` is called).
    4. A cache *key* for that request is derived. This will call the
       instance's ``adjustcachekeystate()`` method so the derivation
       can be influenced.
    5. The cacher is informed of the derived cache key via a call to
       ``setcachekey()``.
    6. The cacher's ``lookup()`` method is called to test for presence of
       the derived key in the cache.
    7. If ``lookup()`` returns a hit, that cached result is used in place
       of invoking the command function. ``__exit__`` is called and the instance
       is discarded.
    8. The command function is invoked.
    9. ``onobject()`` is called for each object emitted by the command
       function.
    10. After the final object is seen, ``onfinished()`` is called.
    11. ``__exit__`` is called to signal the end of use of the instance.

    Cache *key* derivation can be influenced by the instance.

    Cache keys are initially derived by a deterministic representation of
    the command request. This includes the command name, arguments, protocol
    version, etc. This initial key derivation is performed by CBOR-encoding a
    data structure and feeding that output into a hasher.

    Instances of this interface can influence this initial key derivation
    via ``adjustcachekeystate()``.

    The instance is informed of the derived cache key via a call to
    ``setcachekey()``. The instance must store the key locally so it can
    be consulted on subsequent operations that may require it.

    When constructed, the instance has access to a callable that can be used
    for encoding response objects. This callable receives as its single
    argument an object emitted by a command function. It returns an iterable
    of bytes chunks representing the encoded object. Unless the cacher is
    caching native Python objects in memory or has a way of reconstructing
    the original Python objects, implementations typically call this function
    to produce bytes from the output objects and then store those bytes in
    the cache. When it comes time to re-emit those bytes, they are wrapped
    in a ``wireprototypes.encodedresponse`` instance to tell the output
    layer that they are pre-encoded.

    When receiving the objects emitted by the command function, instances
    can choose what to do with those objects. The simplest thing to do is
    re-emit the original objects. They will be forwarded to the output
    layer and will be processed as if the cacher did not exist.

    Implementations could also choose to not emit objects - instead locally
    buffering objects or their encoded representation. They could then emit
    a single "coalesced" object when ``onfinished()`` is called. In
    this way, the implementation would function as a filtering layer of
    sorts.

    When caching objects, typically the encoded form of the object will
    be stored. Keep in mind that if the original object is forwarded to
    the output layer, it will need to be encoded there as well. For large
    output, this redundant encoding could add overhead. Implementations
    could wrap the encoded object data in ``wireprototypes.encodedresponse``
    instances to avoid this overhead.
