'''share a common history between several working directories

The share extension introduces a new command :hg:`share` to create a new
working directory. This is similar to :hg:`clone`, but doesn't involve
copying or linking the storage of the repository. This allows working on
different branches or changes in parallel without the associated cost in
terms of disk space.

Note: destructive operations or extensions like :hg:`rollback` should be
used with care as they can result in confusing problems.

Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones
-----------------------------------

When this extension is active, :hg:`clone` can be configured to
automatically share/pool storage across multiple clones. This
mode effectively converts :hg:`clone` to :hg:`clone` + :hg:`share`.
The benefit of using this mode is the automatic management of
store paths and intelligent pooling of related repositories.

The following ``share.`` config options influence this feature:

``share.pool``
    Filesystem path where shared repository data will be stored. When
    defined, :hg:`clone` will automatically use shared repository
    storage instead of creating a store inside each clone.

``share.poolnaming``
    How directory names in ``share.pool`` are constructed.

    "identity" means the name is derived from the first changeset in the
    repository. In this mode, different remotes share storage if their
    root/initial changeset is identical. In this mode, the local shared
    repository is an aggregate of all encountered remote repositories.

    "remote" means the name is derived from the source repository's
    path or URL. In this mode, storage is only shared if the path or URL
    requested in the :hg:`clone` command matches exactly to a repository
    that was cloned before.

    The default naming mode is "identity".

    Sharing requirements and configs of source repository with shares:

    By default creating a shared repository only enables sharing a common
    history and does not share requirements and configs between them. This
    may lead to problems in some cases, for example when you upgrade the
    storage format from one repository but does not set related configs
    in the shares.

    Setting `format.exp-share-safe = True` enables sharing configs and
    requirements. This only applies to shares which are done after enabling
    the config option.

    For enabling this in existing shares, enable the config option and reshare.

    For resharing existing shares, make sure your working directory is clean
    and there are no untracked files, delete that share and create a new share.

       using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (mq,
       rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared
       clones. In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to
