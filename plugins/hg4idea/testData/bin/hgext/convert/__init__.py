    """convert a foreign SCM repository to a Mercurial one.

    Accepted source formats [identifiers]:

    - Mercurial [hg]
    - CVS [cvs]
    - Darcs [darcs]
    - git [git]
    - Subversion [svn]
    - Monotone [mtn]
    - GNU Arch [gnuarch]
    - Bazaar [bzr]
    - Perforce [p4]

    Accepted destination formats [identifiers]:

    - Mercurial [hg]
    - Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)

    If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted.
    Otherwise, convert will only import up to the named revision
    (given in a format understood by the source).

    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
    basename of the source with ``-hg`` appended. If the destination
    repository doesn't exist, it will be created.

    By default, all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort.
    Mercurial uses --sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers
    order. Sort modes have the following effects:

    --branchsort  convert from parent to child revision when possible,
                  which means branches are usually converted one after
                  the other. It generates more compact repositories.

    --datesort    sort revisions by date. Converted repositories have
                  good-looking changelogs but are often an order of
                  magnitude larger than the same ones generated by
                  --branchsort.

    --sourcesort  try to preserve source revisions order, only
                  supported by Mercurial sources.

    --closesort   try to move closed revisions as close as possible
                  to parent branches, only supported by Mercurial
                  sources.

    If ``REVMAP`` isn't given, it will be put in a default location
    (``<dest>/.hg/shamap`` by default). The ``REVMAP`` is a simple
    text file that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID
    for that revision, like so::

      <source ID> <destination ID>

    If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created. It's
    updated on each commit copied, so :hg:`convert` can be interrupted
    and can be run repeatedly to copy new commits.

    The authormap is a simple text file that maps each source commit
    author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source SCMs
    that use unix logins to identify authors (e.g.: CVS). One line per
    author mapping and the line format is::

      source author = destination author

    Empty lines and lines starting with a ``#`` are ignored.

    The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files
    and directories. Each line can contain one of the following
    directives::

      include path/to/file-or-dir

      exclude path/to/file-or-dir

      rename path/to/source path/to/destination

    Comment lines start with ``#``. A specified path matches if it
    equals the full relative name of a file or one of its parent
    directories. The ``include`` or ``exclude`` directive with the
    longest matching path applies, so line order does not matter.

    The ``include`` directive causes a file, or all files under a
    directory, to be included in the destination repository, and the
    exclusion of all other files and directories not explicitly
    included. The ``exclude`` directive causes files or directories to
    be omitted. The ``rename`` directive renames a file or directory if
    it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the root of
    the repository, use ``.`` as the path to rename to.

    The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic
    history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is
    useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or
    graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry
    contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two
    comma-separated values::

      key parent1, parent2

    The key is the revision ID in the source
    revision control system whose parents should be modified (same
    format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs
    (in either the source or destination revision control system) that
    should be used as the new parents for that node. For example, if
    you have merged "release-1.0" into "trunk", then you should
    specify the revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the one on
    the "release-1.0" branch as the second.

    The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is
    being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in
    conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination
    to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them
    into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains
    lines of the form::

      original_branch_name new_branch_name

    where "original_branch_name" is the name of the branch in the
    source repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the branch
    is the destination repository. No whitespace is allowed in the
    branch names. This can be used to (for instance) move code in one
    repository from "default" to a named branch.

    Mercurial Source
    ################

    The Mercurial source recognizes the following configuration
    options, which you can set on the command line with ``--config``:

    :convert.hg.ignoreerrors: ignore integrity errors when reading.
        Use it to fix Mercurial repositories with missing revlogs, by
        converting from and to Mercurial. Default is False.

    :convert.hg.saverev: store original revision ID in changeset
        (forces target IDs to change). It takes a boolean argument and
        defaults to False.

    :convert.hg.startrev: convert start revision and its descendants.
        It takes a hg revision identifier and defaults to 0.

    CVS Source
    ##########

    CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS
    to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct
    access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the
    repository is ``:local:``. The conversion uses the top level
    directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses
    CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless
    a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be
    converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS
    sandbox is ignored.

    The following options can be used with ``--config``:

    :convert.cvsps.cache: Set to False to disable remote log caching,
        for testing and debugging purposes. Default is True.

    :convert.cvsps.fuzz: Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is
        allowed between commits with identical user and log message in
        a single changeset. When very large files were checked in as
        part of a changeset then the default may not be long enough.
        The default is 60.

    :convert.cvsps.mergeto: Specify a regular expression to which
        commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
        conversion process will insert a dummy revision merging the
        branch on which this log message occurs to the branch
        indicated in the regex. Default is ``{{mergetobranch
        ([-\\w]+)}}``

    :convert.cvsps.mergefrom: Specify a regular expression to which
        commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
        conversion process will add the most recent revision on the
        branch indicated in the regex as the second parent of the
        changeset. Default is ``{{mergefrombranch ([-\\w]+)}}``

    :convert.localtimezone: use local time (as determined by the TZ
        environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default
        is False (use UTC).

    :hooks.cvslog: Specify a Python function to be called at the end of
        gathering the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the
        log entries, and can modify the entries in-place, or add or
        delete them.

    :hooks.cvschangesets: Specify a Python function to be called after
        the changesets are calculated from the CVS log. The
        function is passed a list with the changeset entries, and can
        modify the changesets in-place, or add or delete them.

    An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin
    changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its
    parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see
    the command help for more details.

    Subversion Source
    #################

    Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.
    By default, the supplied ``svn://repo/path/`` source URL is
    converted as a single branch. If ``svn://repo/path/trunk`` exists
    it replaces the default branch. If ``svn://repo/path/branches``
    exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If
    ``svn://repo/path/tags`` exists, it is looked for tags referencing
    converted branches. Default ``trunk``, ``branches`` and ``tags``
    values can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths
    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto
    detection.

    The following options can be set with ``--config``:

    :convert.svn.branches: specify the directory containing branches.
        The default is ``branches``.

    :convert.svn.tags: specify the directory containing tags. The
        default is ``tags``.

    :convert.svn.trunk: specify the name of the trunk branch. The
        default is ``trunk``.

    :convert.localtimezone: use local time (as determined by the TZ
        environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default
        is False (use UTC).

    Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,
    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch
    conversions are supported.

    :convert.svn.startrev: specify start Subversion revision number.
        The default is 0.

    Perforce Source
    ###############

    The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a
    client specification as source. It will convert all files in the
    source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches
    and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then
    usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the
    target may be named ``...-hg``.

    It is possible to limit the amount of source history to be
    converted by specifying an initial Perforce revision:

    :convert.p4.startrev: specify initial Perforce revision (a
        Perforce changelist number).

    Mercurial Destination
    #####################

    The following options are supported:

    :convert.hg.clonebranches: dispatch source branches in separate
        clones. The default is False.

    :convert.hg.tagsbranch: branch name for tag revisions, defaults to
        ``default``.

    :convert.hg.usebranchnames: preserve branch names. The default is
        True.
