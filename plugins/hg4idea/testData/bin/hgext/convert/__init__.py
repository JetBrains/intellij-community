    """convert a foreign SCM repository to a Mercurial one.

    Accepted source formats [identifiers]:

    - Mercurial [hg]
    - CVS [cvs]
    - Darcs [darcs]
    - git [git]
    - Subversion [svn]
    - Monotone [mtn]
    - GNU Arch [gnuarch]
    - Bazaar [bzr]
    - Perforce [p4]

    Accepted destination formats [identifiers]:

    - Mercurial [hg]
    - Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)

    If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted.
    Otherwise, convert will only import up to the named revision
    (given in a format understood by the source).

    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
    basename of the source with '-hg' appended. If the destination
    repository doesn't exist, it will be created.

    By default, all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort.
    Mercurial uses --sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers
    order. Sort modes have the following effects:

    --branchsort  convert from parent to child revision when possible,
                  which means branches are usually converted one after
                  the other. It generates more compact repositories.

    --datesort    sort revisions by date. Converted repositories have
                  good-looking changelogs but are often an order of
                  magnitude larger than the same ones generated by
                  --branchsort.

    --sourcesort  try to preserve source revisions order, only
                  supported by Mercurial sources.

    If <REVMAP> isn't given, it will be put in a default location
    (<dest>/.hg/shamap by default). The <REVMAP> is a simple text file
    that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID for that
    revision, like so::

      <source ID> <destination ID>

    If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created. It's
    updated on each commit copied, so convert-repo can be interrupted
    and can be run repeatedly to copy new commits.

    The [username mapping] file is a simple text file that maps each
    source commit author to a destination commit author. It is handy
    for source SCMs that use unix logins to identify authors (eg:
    CVS). One line per author mapping and the line format is:
    srcauthor=whatever string you want

    The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files
    and directories. Comment lines start with '#'. Each line can
    contain one of the following directives::

      include path/to/file

      exclude path/to/file

      rename from/file to/file

    The 'include' directive causes a file, or all files under a
    directory, to be included in the destination repository, and the
    exclusion of all other files and directories not explicitly
    included. The 'exclude' directive causes files or directories to
    be omitted. The 'rename' directive renames a file or directory. To
    rename from a subdirectory into the root of the repository, use
    '.' as the path to rename to.

    The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic
    history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is
    useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or
    graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry
    contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two
    comma-separated values. The key is the revision ID in the source
    revision control system whose parents should be modified (same
    format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs
    (in either the source or destination revision control system) that
    should be used as the new parents for that node. For example, if
    you have merged "release-1.0" into "trunk", then you should
    specify the revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the one on
    the "release-1.0" branch as the second.

    The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is
    being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in
    conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination
    to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them
    into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains
    lines of the form "original_branch_name new_branch_name".
    "original_branch_name" is the name of the branch in the source
    repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the branch is the
    destination repository. This can be used to (for instance) move code
    in one repository from "default" to a named branch.

    Mercurial Source
    ----------------

    --config convert.hg.ignoreerrors=False    (boolean)
        ignore integrity errors when reading. Use it to fix Mercurial
        repositories with missing revlogs, by converting from and to
        Mercurial.
    --config convert.hg.saverev=False         (boolean)
        store original revision ID in changeset (forces target IDs to
        change)
    --config convert.hg.startrev=0            (hg revision identifier)
        convert start revision and its descendants

    CVS Source
    ----------

    CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS
    to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct
    access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the
    repository is :local:. The conversion uses the top level directory
    in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses CVS rlog
    commands to find files to convert. This means that unless a
    filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be
    converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS
    sandbox is ignored.

    The options shown are the defaults.

    --config convert.cvsps.cache=True         (boolean)
        Set to False to disable remote log caching, for testing and
        debugging purposes.
    --config convert.cvsps.fuzz=60            (integer)
        Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed between
        commits with identical user and log message in a single
        changeset. When very large files were checked in as part of a
        changeset then the default may not be long enough.
    --config convert.cvsps.mergeto='{{mergetobranch ([-\\w]+)}}'
        Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are
        matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will
        insert a dummy revision merging the branch on which this log
        message occurs to the branch indicated in the regex.
    --config convert.cvsps.mergefrom='{{mergefrombranch ([-\\w]+)}}'
        Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are
        matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will
        add the most recent revision on the branch indicated in the
        regex as the second parent of the changeset.
    --config hook.cvslog
        Specify a Python function to be called at the end of gathering
        the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the log entries,
        and can modify the entries in-place, or add or delete them.
    --config hook.cvschangesets
        Specify a Python function to be called after the changesets
        are calculated from the the CVS log. The function is passed
        a list with the changeset entries, and can modify the changesets
        in-place, or add or delete them.

    An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin
    changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its
    parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see
    the command help for more details.

    Subversion Source
    -----------------

    Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.
    By default, the supplied "svn://repo/path/" source URL is
    converted as a single branch. If "svn://repo/path/trunk" exists it
    replaces the default branch. If "svn://repo/path/branches" exists,
    its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If
    "svn://repo/path/tags" exists, it is looked for tags referencing
    converted branches. Default "trunk", "branches" and "tags" values
    can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths
    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto
    detection.

    --config convert.svn.branches=branches    (directory name)
        specify the directory containing branches
    --config convert.svn.tags=tags            (directory name)
        specify the directory containing tags
    --config convert.svn.trunk=trunk          (directory name)
        specify the name of the trunk branch

    Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,
    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch
    conversions are supported.

    --config convert.svn.startrev=0           (svn revision number)
        specify start Subversion revision.

    Perforce Source
    ---------------

    The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a
    client specification as source. It will convert all files in the
    source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches
    and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then
    usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the
    target may be named ...-hg.

    It is possible to limit the amount of source history to be
    converted by specifying an initial Perforce revision.

    --config convert.p4.startrev=0            (perforce changelist number)
        specify initial Perforce revision.

    Mercurial Destination
    ---------------------

    --config convert.hg.clonebranches=False   (boolean)
        dispatch source branches in separate clones.
    --config convert.hg.tagsbranch=default    (branch name)
        tag revisions branch name
    --config convert.hg.usebranchnames=True   (boolean)
        preserve branch names
