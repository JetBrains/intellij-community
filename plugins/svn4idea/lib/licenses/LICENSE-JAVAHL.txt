This license applies to all portions of Subversion which are not
externally-maintained libraries (e.g. apr/, apr-util/, and neon/).
Such libraries have their own licenses; we recommend you read them, as
their terms may differ from the terms below.

This is version 1 of this license.  It is also available online at
http://subversion.tigris.org/license-1.html.  If newer versions of
this license are posted there (the same URL, but with the version
number incremented: .../license-2.html, .../license-3.html, and so
on), you may use a newer version instead, at your option.
