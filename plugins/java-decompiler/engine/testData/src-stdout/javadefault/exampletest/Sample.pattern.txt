# A Pattern file (optional)

# You can match patterns in the decompiled java files with it (e.g. make sure no synthetics)

# You give pattern in java regex syntax, applied to the whole java file (multiline|dotall, '.*?' appended and prepended automatically)
# NOTE: you can only define a pattern file for a class containing a main method
# NOTE: each line is stripped of whitespace at begin and end, so use [ ] to match space at end


# decompiled java file content must contain (java regex syntax):
matches:System[.]out[.]println

# decompiled java file must not contain:
!matches:[$]assertionsDisabled
