<body>
Reports properties that are already defined in other sections.
<p>For example:
<pre><code>
[*.java]
indent_size=4
[{*.java,*.js}]
indent_size=2
</code></pre>
The second section includes all <code>*.java</code> files too but it  also redefines indent_size.
As a result the value 2 will be used for files matching <code>*.java</code>.
