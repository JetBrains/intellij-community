Reports file patterns that are redundant as there already are other patterns that define the same scope of files or even a broader one.
For example, in <code>[{*.java,*}]</code> the first <code>*.java</code> pattern defines a narrower scope compared to <code>*</code>.
That is why it is redundant and can be removed.
