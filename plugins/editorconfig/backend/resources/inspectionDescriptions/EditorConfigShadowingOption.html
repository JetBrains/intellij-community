<body>
Reports properties that override the same properties defined earlier in the file.
<p>For example:
<pre><code>
[*.java]
indent_size=4
[{*.java,*.js}]
indent_size=2
</code></pre>
The second section includes the same files as <code>[*.java]</code> but also sets indent_size to value 2.
Thus the first declaration <code>indent_size=4</code>will be ignored.
