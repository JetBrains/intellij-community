Reports properties that are redundant when another applicable section already contains the same property and value.
<p>
For example:
<pre><code>
[*]
indent_size=4
[*.java]
indent_size=4
</code></pre>
are both applicable to <code>*.java</code> files and define the same <code>indent_size</code> value.
