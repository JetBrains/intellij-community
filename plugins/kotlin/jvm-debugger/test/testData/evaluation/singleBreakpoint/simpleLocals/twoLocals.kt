// `x` is not live at the time of the call to l1 at the breakpoint:
// It dies with the return from `f`, before the invocation of `l2`.

// Breaks differently on the old backend: there, it cannot find `l1`
// because it's not in the captures of `l2`.

// EXPRESSION: l1()
// RESULT: Cannot find local variable 'x' with type int
