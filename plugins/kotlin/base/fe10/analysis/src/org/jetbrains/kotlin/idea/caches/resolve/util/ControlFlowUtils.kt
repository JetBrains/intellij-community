/**
 * CFG analysis can emit different diagnostics (`VAL_REASSIGNMENT`, for example), and they are dropped by default in [analyzeControlFlow].
 * Even if they are created and reported, they are not carried to the main [BindingTrace] from the [ControlFlowInformationProviderImpl]
 * when [analyzeControlFlow] is executed.
 *
 * There are few reasons for that:
 *
 * - When [analyzeWithAllCompilerChecks][org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.resolve.ResolutionFacade.analyzeWithAllCompilerChecks] is called,
 * it may also collect all those diagnostics on the Kotlin Frontend side.
 * That might lead to repeating diagnostics, which is annoying and can break a lot of call-sites.
 * - Enabling this by default might prevent some tricky code in the Debugger Evaluator from being compiled.
 * Evaluator is supposed to allow some non-compilable code to be compilable (e.g., re-assigning final local variables).
 * - Some call-sites of the K1 frontend API might already expect that CFG diagnostics are not reported.
 *
 * However, there is an obvious drawback: if someone **needs** such kind of diagnostics reported without calling the potentially expensive
 * [analyzeWithAllCompilerChecks][org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.resolve.ResolutionFacade.analyzeWithAllCompilerChecks], they will not be
 * satisfied with the default behavior.
 * That includes all the calls to the regular [analyze][org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.resolve.ResolutionFacade.analyze], even with the
 * [org.jetbrains.kotlin.resolve.lazy.BodyResolveMode.doControlFlowAnalysis] set to `true`.
 *
 * This [KtFile]-level flag allows **overriding that default behavior to report the CFG diagnostics**, effectively ignoring all the
 * considerations above.
 * Just to be clear: if you call
 * [analyzeWithAllCompilerChecks][org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.resolve.ResolutionFacade.analyzeWithAllCompilerChecks]
 * with this flag set to `true`, **you will get duplicated CFG-related diagnostics**.
 *
 * Rationale for this flag introduction:
 * While this flag does not "fix" the issue of missing CFG diagnostics and is essentially a workaround, it was considered
 * to be a better alternative compared to changing the default behavior of
 * the [analyzeControlFlow] without a careful evaluation of possible side effects.
 *
 * It should not be used by external users, and should be avoided by internal ones.
 * Please consider talking to the Kotlin IntelliJ Plugin team if you have a need to use this flag for any reason.
 *
 * N.B. This flag is K1-frontend specific; it does not have any effect on K2.
