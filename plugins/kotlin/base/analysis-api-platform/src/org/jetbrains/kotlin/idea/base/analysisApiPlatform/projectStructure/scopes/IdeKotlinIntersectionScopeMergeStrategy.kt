/**
 * A [KotlinGlobalSearchScopeMergeStrategy] which merges intersection scopes in a union with *common (equal) individual scopes* that inherit
 * from [KotlinIntersectionScopeMergeTarget].
 *
 * This is legal due to the distributive property of sets. We can model scopes as sets of virtual files, so mathematical laws of sets also
 * apply to the intersections and unions of scopes.
 *
 * For example, take the following combination of sets `A`, `B`, and `C` (with `&` denoting intersection and `|` denoting union):
 *
 * ```
 * (B & A) | (C & A)
 * ```
 *
 * With the distributive law, we can factor out `A`:
 *
 * ```
 * (B | C) & A
 * ```
 *
 * Here, we've already reduced the scope construction from two intersections and a union to just a single intersection and union. But we can
 * go a step further and put `B | C` through the [KaGlobalSearchScopeMerger][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.platform.projectStructure.KaGlobalSearchScopeMerger]
 * again, which gives us the opportunity to merge `B` and `C`. This wouldn't have been possible without factoring out `A`.
 *
 * The content scopes of [KaLibraryModule][org.jetbrains.kotlin.analysis.api.projectStructure.KaLibraryModule]s are a real-life case where
 * this is applied. The Analysis API restricts the content scope based on the library's target platform (see
 * `KaFirLibraryTargetPlatformContentScopeRefiner` in the Analysis API), which is applied via an intersection. Because there is only a
 * single instance of the restriction scope per target platform, we can easily factor out the same restriction scope. This allows us to
 * merge the library scopes per target platform.
