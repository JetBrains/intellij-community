<p>Reports private property names that do not follow the recommended naming conventions.</p>
<p>
    Consistent naming allows for easier code reading and understanding.
    According to the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#naming-rules">Kotlin official style guide</a>,
    private property names should start with a lowercase letter and use camel case.
    Optionally, underscore prefix is allowed but only for <b>private</b> properties.
</p>
<p>It is possible to introduce other naming rules by changing the "Pattern" regular expression.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  val _My_Cool_Property = ""
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix renames the class according to the Kotlin naming conventions:</p>
<pre><code>
  val _myCoolProperty = ""
</code></pre>
