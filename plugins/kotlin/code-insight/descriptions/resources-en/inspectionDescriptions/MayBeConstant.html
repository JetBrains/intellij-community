Reports top-level <code>val</code> properties in objects that might be declared as <code>const</code>
for better performance and Java interoperability.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  object A {
      val foo = 1
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  object A {
      const val foo = 1
  }
</code></pre>
<b>For library authors:</b> using const for public API symbols is dangerous as two different values may be used if the compile-time version of the library is not the same as the run-time version of the library. Use with caution.
