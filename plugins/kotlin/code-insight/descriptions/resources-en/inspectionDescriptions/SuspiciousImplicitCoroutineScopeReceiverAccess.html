<p>Reports potentially problematic implicit <code>CoroutineScope</code> receiver access from within a suspending context.</p>

<p>
    When a suspend function or lambda captures an implicit <code>CoroutineScope</code> receiver from the outer context, it might lead to
    unexpected behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Such code can be prone to violating the rules of Structured Concurrency, 
    even though it might look deceptively well-structured.
</p>
<p>
    This can lead to incorrect behaviors when handling errors, 
    cancelling computations, or managing lifetimes.
</p>

<p><b>A typical example:</b></p>

<pre><code>
fun processFlow(flow: Flow&lt;String&gt;) {
  runBlocking {
    flow.collectLatest {
      
      // launched on this@runBlocking CoroutineScope
      launch { 
        longProcessing(value)
      }
  
    }
  }
}
  
suspend fun longProcessing(value: String) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>
    In the example above, the <code>launch { ... }</code> call launches coroutines in the implicit
    <code>CoroutineScope</code> from the outer <code>runBlocking</code> call.
</p>
<p>
    Because of this, <code>collectLatest</code> would not be able
    to cancel those coroutines when it needs to.
</p>
<p>
    This inspection will detect that <code>launch</code> is called on a
    <code>CoroutineScope</code> which is captured from the outside of the current
    suspending lambda (i.e. <code>collectLatest</code>'s body).
</p>
<p>
    For more information about this particular problem, see <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/3533">this GitHub Issue</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Possible solutions:</b></p>

<p>To fix this issue, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use <code>coroutineScope { ... }</code> builder to create a child scope that is tied to the suspend function's lifecycle</li>
    <li>Rearrange the code so that the implicit <code>CoroutineScope</code> comes from the current syntactical context</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In case you are sure that the code is correct, you can explicitly specify the receiver
    to make your intention clear. In the example above, that would be <code>this@runBlocking.launch { ... }</code>.
    Note, however, that in this case the semantics of the code <b>won't change</b>.
