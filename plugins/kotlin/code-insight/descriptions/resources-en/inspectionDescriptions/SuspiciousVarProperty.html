Reports <code>var</code> properties with default setter and getter that do not reference backing field.
<p>
Such properties do not affect calling its setter; therefore, it will be clearer to change such property to <code>val</code> and delete the initializer.
</p>
<p><b>Change to val and delete initializer</b> quick-fix can be used to amend the code automatically.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  // This property always returns '1' and it doesn't important that the property is a 'var'
  var foo: Int = 0
      get() = 1
</code></pre>
