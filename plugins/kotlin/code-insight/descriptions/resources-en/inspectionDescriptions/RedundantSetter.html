Reports redundant property setters.
<p>
Setter is considered to be redundant in one of the following cases:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Setter has no body. Accessor visibility isn't changed, declaration isn't <code>external</code> and has no annotations.
        <pre><code>
  var myPropWithRedundantSetter: Int = 0
      set // redundant

  var myPropA: Int = 0
      private set // OK - property visibility is changed to private

  var myPropB: Int = 0
      external set // OK - implemented not in Kotlin (external)

  var myPropC: Int = 0
      @Inject set // OK - accessor is annotated
        </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Setter body is a block with a single statement assigning the parameter to the backing field.
        <pre><code>
  var prop: Int = 0
      set(value) { // redundant
          field = value
      }
       </code></pre>
    </li>
</ol>
