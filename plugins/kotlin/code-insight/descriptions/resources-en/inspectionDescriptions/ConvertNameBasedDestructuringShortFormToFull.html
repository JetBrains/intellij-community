Reports destructuring declarations in short form and suggests converting them to the full form with explicit property names. Applies for data classes.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  data class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String)
  val (first, lastName) = person
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix converts to full form destructuring:</p>
<pre><code>
  (val first = firstName, val lastName) = person
</code></pre>
<p>This form makes the mapping between variables and properties explicit.</p>
