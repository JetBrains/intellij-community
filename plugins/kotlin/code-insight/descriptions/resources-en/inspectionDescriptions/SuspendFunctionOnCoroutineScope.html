Reports calls and accesses of <code>CoroutineScope</code> extensions or members inside suspend functions with <code>CoroutineScope</code> receiver.
<p>When a function is <code>suspend</code> and has <code>CoroutineScope</code> receiver,
    it has ambiguous access to <code>CoroutineContext</code> via <code>kotlin.coroutines.coroutineContext</code> and via <code>CoroutineScope.coroutineContext</code>,
    and two these contexts are different in general.</p>
<p>
To improve this situation, one can wrap suspicious call inside <code>coroutineScope { ... }</code> or
get rid of <code>CoroutineScope</code> function receiver.
