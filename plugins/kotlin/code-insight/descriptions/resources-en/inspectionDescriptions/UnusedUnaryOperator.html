Reports unary operators for number types on unused expressions.
<p>Unary operators break previous expression if they are used without braces.
As a result, mathematical expressions spanning multi lines can be misleading.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
  fun main() {
      val result = 1 + 2 * 3
                  + 3              // &lt;== note that '+ 3' doesn't belong to the 'result' variable, it is unused
      println("Result = $result")  // The result is '7' and not '10' as it might be expected
  }
</code></pre>
