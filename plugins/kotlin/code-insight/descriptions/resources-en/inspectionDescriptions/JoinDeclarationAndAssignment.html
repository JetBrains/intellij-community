Reports property declarations that can be joined with the following assignment.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  val x: String
  x = System.getProperty("")
</code></pre>
<p>The quick fix joins the declaration with the assignment:</p>
<pre><code>
  val x = System.getProperty("")
</code></pre>

<p>Configure the inspection:</p>
<p>You can disable the option <b>Report with complex initialization of member properties</b> to skip properties with complex initialization. This covers two cases:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The property initializer is complex (it is a multiline or a compound/control-flow expression)</li>
    <li>The property is first initialized and then immediately used in subsequent code (for example, to call additional initialization methods)</li>
</ol>
