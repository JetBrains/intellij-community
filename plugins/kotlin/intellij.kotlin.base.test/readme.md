This is a module for abstract kotlin tests without explicit dependency on K1 plugin. For now, `kotlin.test-common` and `kotlin.test-framework`
depend on K1 but this should be solved in the nearest future. As an ultimate goal, the current module should be removed together with K1.
Abstract classes would be merged with K2 counterparts.
