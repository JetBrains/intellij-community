<p>Reports inline functions with not nullable extension receivers which does not use the fact that extension receiver is not nullable.</p>
<p>
    In Kotlin 1.0 or 1.1, calls of <code>inline fun</code> with flexible nullable extension (platform type with unknown nullability)
    receiver did not include nullability check in bytecode, but in Kotlin 1.2 this problem is fixed
    (see <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12899">KT-12899</a>), nullability check is included into bytecode.
</p>
<p>
    Thus functions which do not use the fact that extension receiver is not nullable are dangerous in Kotlin until 1.2 and it's
    recommended to make such functions to have nullable receiver.

<p>This inspection only reports if the Kotlin language level of the project or module is lower than 1.2.</p>
