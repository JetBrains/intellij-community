<p>Reports potentially unsafe calls of inline functions with flexible nullable (platform type with unknown nullability) extension receivers.</p>
<p>
    Before Kotlin 1.2, calls of <code>inline fun</code> with flexible nullable extension receiver (a platform type with an unknown
    nullability) did not include nullability checks in bytecode. Since Kotlin 1.2, nullability checks are included into the bytecode
    (see <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12899">KT-12899</a>).
</p>
<p>
    It's recommended to add explicit <code>!!</code> if exception is what you want,
    or consider changing the function's receiver type to nullable if it should work without exceptions.
</p>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied: explicit <code>!!</code> is added to receiver.</p>

<p>This inspection only reports if the Kotlin language level of the project or module is lower than 1.2.</p>
