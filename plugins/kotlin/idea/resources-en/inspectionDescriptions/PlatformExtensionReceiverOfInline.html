<p>Reports potentially unsafe calls of inline functions with flexible nullable (platform type with unknown nullability) extension receivers.</p>
<p>
    In Kotlin 1.0 or 1.1, calls of <code>inline fun</code> with flexible nullable extension (platform type with unknown nullability)
    receiver did not include nullability check in bytecode, but in Kotlin 1.2 this problem is fixed
    (see <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12899">KT-12899</a>), nullability check is included into bytecode.
</p>
<p>
    It's recommended to add explicit <code>!!</code> if exception is what you want,
    or consider changing the function's receiver type to nullable if it should work without exceptions.
</p>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied: explicit <code>!!</code> is added to receiver.</p>

<p>This inspection only reports if the Kotlin language level of the project or module is lower than 1.2.</p>
