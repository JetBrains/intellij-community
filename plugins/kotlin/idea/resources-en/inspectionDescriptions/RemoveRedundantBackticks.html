Reports redundant backticks in references.
<p>
    Some of the Kotlin keywords are valid identifiers in Java: <code>in</code>, <code>object</code>, <code>is</code>, and other.
    If a Java library uses a Kotlin keyword for a method, you can still call the method escaping it with the backtick (`) character, for example,
    <code>foo.`is`(bar)</code>.
    Sometimes escaping is redundant and can be safely omitted. The inspection discovers and reports such cases and is
    paired with the 'Remove redundant backticks' quick-fix, which allows you to amend highlighted code snippet.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>
  fun `is`(x: String) {}
  fun foo() {
      `is`("bar") // 'is' is a keyword, backticks are required
  }

  fun `test that smth works as designed`() {} // it's ok, complex identifier for readability improvement

  val `a` = 1  // no need for backticks
</code></pre>
