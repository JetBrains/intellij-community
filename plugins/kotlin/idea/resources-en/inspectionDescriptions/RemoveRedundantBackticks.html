Reports redundant backticks in references.
<p>
    Some of the Kotlin keywords are valid identifiers in Java: in, object, is, and other.
    If a Java library uses a Kotlin keyword for a method, you can still call the method escaping it with the backtick (`) character, for example,
    "foo.`is`(bar)".
    Sometimes escaping is redundant and can be safely omitted. The inspection discovers and reports such cases and is
    paired with the 'Remove redundant backticks' quick-fix, which allows you to amend highlighted code snippet.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>
   fun `is`(x: String) {}
   fun foo() {
      `is`("bar") // 'is' is a keyword, backticks are required
   }

   fun `test that smth works as designed`() // it's ok, complex identifier for readability improvement

   val `a` = 1  // no need for backticks
</code></pre>
