Reports usages of Kotlin <code>internal</code> declarations in Java code that is located in a different module.
<p>
    The <code>internal</code> keyword is designed to restrict access to a class, function, or property from other modules.
    Due to JVM limitations, <code>internal</code> classes, functions, and properties can still be
    accessed from outside Kotlin, which may later lead to compatibility problems.
