Reports <i>IntProgression.fromClosedRange()</i> and <i>LongProgression.fromClosedRange()</i> with
<i>MIN_VALUE</i> step.
<p>
Since Kotlin 1.3 it's prohibited to call <i>IntProgression.fromClosedRange()</i> and <i>LongProgression.fromClosedRange()</i> with
<i>MIN_VALUE</i> step. All such calls should be checked during migration to Kotlin 1.3+.
