Reports calls & accesses of <code>CoroutineScope</code> extensions or members
inside suspend functions with <code>CoroutineScope</code> receiver.

Both suspend functions and <code>CoroutineScope</code> members & extensions have access to <code>coroutineContext</code>.
When some function is simultaneously suspend <b>and</b> has <code>CoroutineScope</code> receiver,
it has ambiguous access to <code>CoroutineContext</code>:
first via <code>kotlin.coroutines.coroutineContext</code> and second via <code>CoroutineScope.coroutineContext</code>,
and two these contexts are different in general case.
So when we call some <code>CoroutineScope</code> extension or access <code>coroutineContext</code> from such a function,
it's unclear which from these two context do we have in mind.

Normal ways to fix this are to wrap suspicious call inside <code>coroutineScope { ... }</code> or
to get rid of <code>CoroutineScope</code> function receiver.
