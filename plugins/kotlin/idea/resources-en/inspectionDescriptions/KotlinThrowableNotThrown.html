Reports instantiations of <code>Throwable</code> or its subclasses, when the created <code>Throwable</code>
is never actually thrown.
<p>The reported code indicates mistakes that are hard to catch in tests.</p>
<p>
    Also, this inspection reports method calls that return instances of <code>Throwable</code> or its subclasses,
    when the resulting <code>Throwable</code> instance is not thrown.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  fun check(condition: Boolean) {
      if (!condition) /* throw is missing here */ IllegalArgumentException("condition is not met");
  }

  fun createError() = RuntimeException()

  fun foo() {
      /* throw is missing here */ createError()
  }
</code></pre>
