<p><i>Task</i><i>scheduler</i><code>interface</code> that abstracts the scheduling of <code>Runnables</code> based on different kinds of triggers.</p>
<p>This interface is separate from <code>SchedulingTaskExecutor</code> since it usually represents for a different kind of backend, i.e. a thread pool with different characteristics and capabilities. Implementations may implement both interfaces if they can handle both kinds of execution characteristics.</p>
