The idea behind this test data is to collect projects that users most probably will face. 
These are:
1. Projects which we generate via IDEA wizard. See directories with the `wizard` prefix.
2. Projects available at [Gradle Sample Index](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/).  See directories with the `gradleSample` prefix.
