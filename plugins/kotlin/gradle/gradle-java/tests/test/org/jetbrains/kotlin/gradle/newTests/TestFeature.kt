/**
 * Represents a single tweak/additional check of tests.
 *
 * Recommended usage:
 * 1. inherit [TestFeature]
 * Tip: use `object` for implementors
 *
 * 2. if your test feature provides some per-test configuration, create a mutable class
 * and pass it as [V]. Please, store all settings there and do not extend [KotlinMppTestsContext]
 *
 * 3. override needed lifetime hooks and implement actual behaviour of the test feature
 *
 * 4. if necessary, provide the DSL for configuring your test feature by adding extension
 * functions on [TestConfigurationDslScope]
 * Tip: scope all extension-functions to a named interface, and inherit that
 * interface in relevant test suites. This helps with the completion speed/relevance a lot
 *
 * 5. install the feature in the relevant test suite
 * Default: add to [AbstractKotlinMppGradleImportingTest.installedFeatures])
 *
 * See also [AbstractTestChecker] for simplified API for test features which just provide
 * additional test assertions/checks.

 *   `TestConfiguration`-DSL block. This is because TestConfiguration is instantiated at
 *   the test execution phase (`doTest`) that happens after setUp
 *
 * - [additionalSetUp] is executed after the main JUnit's setUp executed, order with other
 *   'before'-methods coming from JUnit rules is not defined (please avoid mixing them)
 *
 * - [additionalTearDown] is executed before the JUnit's tearDown is executed, order with other
 *   'after'-methods coming from JUnit rules is not defined (please avoid mixing them)
 *
 * - [additionalTearDown] is guaranteed to be executed if respective [additionalSetUp] was executed
 *   (difference from [TestFeature.afterImport] that happens effectively at the same stage of test's lifecyle,
 *   but doesn't have that guarantee)
