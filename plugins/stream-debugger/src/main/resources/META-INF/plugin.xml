      <p>In some ways, Stream API is better than traditional loop approach: it takes full advantage of modern multi-core architectures,
      and lets you process data in a declarative way. What's also good is that this approach helps to avoid the state issues, and the
      code written in it looks more elegant. But, there's a certain downside to it: the code sometimes is sure hard to read, understand,
      and, of course, to debug.</p>
      <p>This plugin is here to amend that and offer solutions to the issues you might run into. It extends the <em>Debugger</em>
      tool window by adding the <em>Trace Current Stream Chain</em> button, which becomes active when debugger stops inside of a
      chain of Stream API calls.</p>

      <p>After you click it, the current data stream is evaluated and you get a visualization of what exactly happens to each element
      from the first call to last, with changes occurring gradually as it's passing thru all the steps:</p>

      <p>The <em>Split Mode button</em> in the left bottom corner lets you choose whether you want to see all operations at once or
      separately:</p>

      <p>In the latter mode, you can switch between operations manually using the tabs on top.</p>

      <p>The plugin is still under development, so expect a couple of glitches here and there, and, of course, we really appreciate your
      feedback, including error reports, and we have set up an
      <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues?q=Subsystem:%20%7BDebugger.%20Streams%7D">issue tracker</a> just for that.
