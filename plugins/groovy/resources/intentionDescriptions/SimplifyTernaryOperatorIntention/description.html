<span style="font-family: verdana,serif; font-size: smaller;">
This intention simplifies a conditional operator <b><font color="#000080">?:</font></b> when one of the branches is a constant true or false.
<br>
  So <code>a ? b : false</code> gets turned into <code>a && b</code> and <code>a ? true : b</code> gets turned into <code>a || b</code>.<br>
  While you would normally not write such code, you may end up with it as a result of other refactorings.
