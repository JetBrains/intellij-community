Reports non-<code>final</code>, non-<code>private</code> fields which are accessed in a synchronized context.
<p>
  A non-private field cannot be guaranteed to always be accessed in a synchronized manner, and such "partially synchronized"
  access may result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures. Accesses in constructors an initializers are ignored
  for purposes of this inspection.
