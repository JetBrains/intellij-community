This inspection reports any instances of non-final, non-private fields which are accessed in a synchronized context in Groovy code.
A non-private field cannot be guaranteed to always be accessed in a synchronized manner, and such "partially synchronized"
access may result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures. Accesses in constructors an initializers are ignored
for purposes of this inspection.
