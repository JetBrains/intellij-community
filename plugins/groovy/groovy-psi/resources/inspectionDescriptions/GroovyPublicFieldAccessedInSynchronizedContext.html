Reports non-<b>final</b>, non-<b>private</b> fields which are accessed in a synchronized context.
A non-private field cannot be guaranteed to always be accessed in a synchronized manner, and such "partially synchronized"
access may result in unexpectedly inconsistent data structures. Accesses in constructors an initializers are ignored
for purposes of this inspection.
