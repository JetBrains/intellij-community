This inspection reports any instances of Groovy <b><font color="#000080">for</font></b> , <b><font color="#000080">while</font></b> ,
or <b><font color="#000080">do</font></b> statements which
can only exit by throwing an exception. While such statements may be correct, they
are often a symptom of coding errors.
