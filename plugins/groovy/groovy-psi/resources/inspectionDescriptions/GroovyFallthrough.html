Reports <i>fallthrough</i> in switch statements.  While occasionally useful, fallthrough is often unintended, and may lead to surprising bugs.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
<code>
switch(n) {
  case 1:
    print 1
  case 2: // "case 1" fallthrough to "case 2". Statements from "case 2" will be executed immediately after "case 1".
    print 2
    break
  default:
    print "Default"
}
