This inspection reports any methods which may safely be made <b>static</b> . A method may be static if it is not synchronized, it does not
reference any of its class' non static methods and non static fields and is not overridden in a sub class.
Use the checkboxes below to inspect only <b>private</b> or <b>final methods</b> , which increases the performance of this inspection and to
ignore empty methods.
