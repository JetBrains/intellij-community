Reports synchronized blocks which lock on an object which is initialized with a
literal. String literals are interned and <b>Number</b> literals can be allocated from a cache. Because of
this, it is possible that some other part of the system which uses an object initialized with the same
literal, is actually holding a reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock
situations, if the string was thought to be private.
