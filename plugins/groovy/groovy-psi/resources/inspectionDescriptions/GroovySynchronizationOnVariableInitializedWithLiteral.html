                This inspection reports any Groovy synchronized block which locks on an object which is initilized with a
                literal. String literals are interned and Number literals can be allocated from a cache. Because of
                this, it is possible that some other part of the system which uses an object initialized with the same
                literal, is actually holding a reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock
                situations, if the string was thought to be private.
