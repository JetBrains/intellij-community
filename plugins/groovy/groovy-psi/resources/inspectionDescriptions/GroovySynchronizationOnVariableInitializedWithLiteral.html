Reports synchronized blocks which lock on an object which is initialized with a literal.
<p>
  String literals are interned and <code>Number</code> literals can be allocated from a cache. Because of
  this, it is possible that some other part of the system which uses an object initialized with the same
  literal, is actually holding a reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock
  situations, if the string was thought to be private.
