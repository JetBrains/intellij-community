<p>Reports unused classes, methods and fields.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  public class Department {
      private Organization myOrganization;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>Department</code> explicitly references <code>Organization</code> but if <code>Department</code> class itself is unused,
then inspection would report both classes. 

<p>
The inspection also reports parameters, which are not used by their methods and all method implementations/overriders, as well as local
variables, which are declared but not used.
