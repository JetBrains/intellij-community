Reports pointless or pointlessly complicated boolean expressions.
<p>
  Such expressions include conjunction with true,
  disjunction with false,
  equality comparison with a boolean literal, or negation of a boolean literal. Such expressions may be
  the result of automated refactorings
  not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
  intended to do.
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  if (someBool && true) {}
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  if (someBool) {}
</code></pre>
