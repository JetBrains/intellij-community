                This inspection reports any instances of pointless or pointlessly
                complicated boolean expressions in Groovy code. Such expressions include <b><font
                    color="#000080">and</font></b>ing with true,
                <b><font color="#000080">or</font></b>ing with false,
                equality comparison with a boolean literal, or negation of a boolean literal. Such expressions may be
                the result of automated refactorings
                not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
                intended to do.
