Reports pointless or pointlessly
complicated boolean expressions. Such expressions include <b>and</b>ing with true,
<b>or</b>ing with false,
equality comparison with a boolean literal, or negation of a boolean literal. Such expressions may be
the result of automated refactorings
not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
intended to do.
