Reports statements which use a <b>GString</b> object as a key to map.
In general <b>GString</b> objects are mutable and probably should not be used as keys.
<p>
Also, a <b>GString</b> entry cannot be accessed with a <b>java.lang.String</b> object with same value. Example:
<br>
<pre>
    def map = [:]
    <b>def</b> key = 'foo'
    map &lt&lt ["${key}": 'bar']
    <b>assert </b> map[key] == <b>null</b>
</pre>
