This inspection reports any instances of Groovy statements which attempts to put GString object as a key to map.
In a general way GString objects are mutable and probably should not be used as keys.
<p>
Also, GString entry could not be accessed with java.lang.String object with same value. Example:
<br>
<pre>
    def map = [:]
    <b><font color="#000080">def</font></b> key = 'foo'
    map &lt&lt ["${key}": 'bar']
    <b><font color="#000080">assert </font></b> map[key] == <b><font color="#000080">null</font></b>
</pre>
