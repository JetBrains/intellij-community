<p>Reports instance <code>main</code> methods that are declared inside nested classes.</p>

<p>
  The invocation of <code>main</code> method within nested classes is not handled directly by Groovy; however, it is possible by delegating the execution to Java.
  In such a scenario, the code will be executed successfully only if the Java version is enough. Consider the following example:
</p>
<pre><code>
class Outer {
  static class Nested {
    void main() {
      println 'Hello from nested'
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

The code runs successfully with Java 25, but not with Java 17.
