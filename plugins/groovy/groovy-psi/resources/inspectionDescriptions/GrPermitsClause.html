<p>Reports permitted classes that do not extend the sealed base class.<p>
<p>Groovy does not require that all permitted classes should be available in compile-time and compiled along with base class. Compiler will not warn the user on dealing with non-extending permitted subclass, but it contradicts the nature of sealed classes.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  class A permits B {} // reports B
  class B {}
</code></pre>
