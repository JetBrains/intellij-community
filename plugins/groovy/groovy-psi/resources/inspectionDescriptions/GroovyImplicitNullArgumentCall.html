<html>
<body>
Reports calls with no arguments to method that has exactly one parameter.
This is equivalent to call with <code>null</code>, and that behavior is often confusing and unintended.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
<code>
def foo(String s){}
foo() // this call is actually 'foo(null)' call
</code>
</pre>
</body>
