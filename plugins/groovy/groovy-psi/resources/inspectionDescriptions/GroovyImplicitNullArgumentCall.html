<html>
<body>
Reports calls with no arguments to method that has exactly one parameter.
This is equivalent to call with <code>null</code>, and that behavior is often confusing and unintended.
<br>
Example:
<br>
<pre>
    def foo(String s){}

    foo()
</pre>
Will be executed as following:
<pre>
    def foo(String s){}

    foo(<b>null</b>)
</pre>
