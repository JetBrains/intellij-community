Reports any instances of assignment a variable declared in a Groovy <b><font color="#000080">for</font></b> statement
in the body of that statement. It also reports any attempt to increment or decrement the variable.
While occasionally intended, this construct can be extremely confusing, and is often the result of a typo.
