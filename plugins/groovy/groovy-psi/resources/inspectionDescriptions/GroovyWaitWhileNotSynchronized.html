This inspection reports any call to <b><font color="#000080">wait()</font></b> not made inside a corresponding synchronized
statement or synchronized method within Groovy code. Calling <b><font color="#000080">wait()</font></b> on an object
without holding a lock on that object will result in an IllegalMonitorStateException being thrown.
Such a construct is not necessarily an error, as the necessary lock may be acquired before
the containing method is called, but its worth looking at.
