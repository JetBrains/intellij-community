<p>Reports calls to <code>wait()</code> not made inside a corresponding synchronized
  statement or synchronized method.</p>
<p>Calling <code>wait()</code> on an object
without holding a lock on that object will result in an <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> being thrown.
Such a construct is not necessarily an error, as the necessary lock may be acquired before
the containing method is called, but its worth looking at.</p>
