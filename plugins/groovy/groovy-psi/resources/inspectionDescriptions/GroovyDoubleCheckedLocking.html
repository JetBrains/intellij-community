This inspection reports any instances of the double-checked locking construct in Groovy code. For a
discussion of double-checked locking and why it is unsafe, see
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html
">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html</a>

<p>
 Use the checkbox below to ignore double-checked locking on volatile fields. Using
 a volatile field for double-checked locking works correctly on Java 5 virtual machines,
 but probably does not have any performance advantages over plain full synchronization
 of the accessor method.
