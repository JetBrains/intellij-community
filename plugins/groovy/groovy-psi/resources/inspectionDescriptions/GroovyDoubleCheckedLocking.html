Reports double-checked locking. For a
discussion of double-checked locking and why it is unsafe, see

<p>
 Use the checkbox below to ignore double-checked locking on volatile fields. Using
 a volatile field for double-checked locking works correctly on Java 5 virtual machines,
 but probably does not have any performance advantages over plain full synchronization
 of the accessor method.
