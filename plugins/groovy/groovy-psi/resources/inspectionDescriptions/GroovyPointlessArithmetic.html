                This inspection reports any instances of pointless arithmetic
                expressions in Groovy code. Such expressions include adding or subtracting zero, multiplying by zero or one,
                division by one, and shift by zero. Such expressions may be the result of automated refactorings
                not completely followed through to completion, and in any case are unlikely to be what the developer
                intended to do.
