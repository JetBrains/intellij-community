Reports instances of assignment operations in Groovy which can be replaced by operator-assignment. Code
using operator assignment may be clearer, and theoretically more performant.
<p>
 Use the check box below to ignore the conditional operators <b><font color="#000080">&amp;&amp;</font></b>
 and <b><font color="#000080">||</font></b>. Replacing conditional operators with operator
 assignment modifies the semantics of the expression.
