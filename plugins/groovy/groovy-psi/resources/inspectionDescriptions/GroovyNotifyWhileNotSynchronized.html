Reports calls to <code>notify()</code> and <code>notifyAll()</code> not within a corresponding
synchronized statement or synchronized method.
<p>
  Calling these methods on an object
  without holding a lock on that object will result in an <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> being thrown.
  Such a construct is not necessarily an error, as the necessary lock may be acquired before
  the containing method is called, but it's worth looking at.
