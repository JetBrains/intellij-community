                Reports any calls to <b><font color="#000080">Thread.stop()</font></b>,
                <b><font color="#000080">Thread.suspend()</font></b>, or <b><font color="#000080">Thread.resume()</font></b>
                from Groovy code.
                These calls are inherently prone to data corruption and deadlock, and their use is strongly
                discouraged.
