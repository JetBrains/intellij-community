Reports classes or files that contain multiple overloaded <code>main</code> methods in Groovy 5.
<p>
  When a class or file has several <code>main</code> methods with different signatures, it can be unclear which one serves as the
  application's entry point because the invocation of the main method occurs at runtime based on the presence of arguments. Consider the following example:
</p>
<pre><code>
class A {
    void main(String[] args) {
        println "1"
    }

    void main() {
        println "2"
    }
}
</code></pre>
If no arguments are passed, then the <code>main()</code>, otherwise the <code>main(String[])</code> will be invoked.
