This inspection reports instances of Groovy <b><font color="#000080">synchronized</font></b> statements where the lock expression
is a non- <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> field. Such statements are unlikely to have useful semantics, as different
threads may be locking on different objects even when operating on the same object.
