<p>Reports the cases where a variable is redundant as its value is never used after its assignment.</p>
<p>If the variable is unused, we recommend removing it to shorten the code and to avoid redundant allocations.</p>
<p>The following cases are reported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the variable never gets read after assignment</li>
  <li>the value is always overwritten with another assignment before the next variable read</li>
  <li>the variable initializer is redundant (for one of the above two reasons)</li>
</ul>
