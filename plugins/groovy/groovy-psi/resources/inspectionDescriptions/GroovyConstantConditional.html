Reports any instances of Groovy conditional expressions of the form
<b><font color="#000080">true?<i>result1</i>:<i>result2</i></font></b> or <b><font
    color="#000080">false?<i>result1</i>:<i>result2</i></font></b> .
These expressions sometimes occur as the result of automatic refactorings, and may obviously be simplified.
