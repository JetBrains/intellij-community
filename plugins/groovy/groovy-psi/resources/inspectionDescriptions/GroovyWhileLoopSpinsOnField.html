This inspection reports on any instances of Groovy <b><font color="#000080">while</font></b> loops which spin on the
value of a non-volatile field, waiting for it to be changed by another thread. In addition to being potentially
extremely CPU intensive when little work is done inside the loop, such
loops are likely have different semantics than intended, as the Java Memory Model allows such field accesses
to be hoisted out of the loop, causing the loop to never complete even if another thread does change the
field's value.
