Reports synchronization which uses <code>this</code> as its lock expression.
<p>
  Constructs reported include <code>synchronized</code>
  blocks which lock <code>this</code>, and calls to <code>wait()</code>
  <code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()</code> which target <code>wait()</code>.
  Such constructs, like synchronized methods, make it hard to track just who is locking on a given
  object, and make possible "denial of service" attacks on objects. As an alternative, consider
  locking on a private instance variable, access to which can be completely controlled.
