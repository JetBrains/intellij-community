Reports any uses of the non-short-circuit forms of boolean 'and' and 'or' ( <b><font
    color="#000080">&</font></b>
and <b><font color="#000080">|</font></b> ) in Groovy code. The non-short-circuit versions are occasionally useful, but
their presence is often due to typos of the short-circuit forms ( <b><font color="#000080">&&</font></b>
and <b><font color="#000080">||</font></b> ), and may lead to subtle bugs.
