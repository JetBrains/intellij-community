Reports calls to <b>System.runFinalizersOnExit()</b>.
This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language. It is inherently non-thread-safe,
may result in data corruption, deadlock, and may affect parts of the program far removed from it's call point.
It is deprecated, and it's use strongly discouraged.
