Reports calls to <code>System.runFinalizersOnExit()</code>.
<p>
  This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language. It is inherently non-thread-safe,
  may result in data corruption, deadlock, and may affect parts of the program far removed from its call point.
  It is deprecated, and its use is strongly discouraged.
