Reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">break</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">continue</font></b>
statements
inside of <b><font color="#000080">finally</font></b>
blocks in Groovy code. While occasionally intended, such statements are very confusing, may mask exceptions thrown, and
tremendously complicate debugging.
