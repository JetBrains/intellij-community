Reports on any call to <b><font color="#000080">wait()</font></b> from Groovy code not made inside a loop. <b><font
    color="#000080">wait()</font></b> is normally
used to suspend a thread until a condition is true, and that condition should be checked after the <b><font
    color="#000080">wait()</font></b>
returns. A loop is the clearest way to achieve this.
