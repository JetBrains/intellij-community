<body>
This intention simplifies a conditional operator <b><font color="#000080">?:</font></b> when one of the branches is a constant true or
false.
<br>
So <code>a ? b : false</code> gets turned into <code>a && b</code> and <code>a ? true : b</code> gets turned into <code>a || b</code> . <br>
While you would normally not write such code, you may end up with it as a result of other refactorings.
