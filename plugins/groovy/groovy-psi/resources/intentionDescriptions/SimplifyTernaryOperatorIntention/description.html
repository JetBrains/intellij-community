<p>Simplifies a conditional operator <b>?:</b> when one of the branches is a constant true or false.</p>
<p>So <code>a ? b : false</code> gets turned into <code>a && b</code> and <code>a ? true : b</code> gets turned into <code>a || b</code> .</p>
<p>While you would normally not write such code, you may end up with it as a result of other refactorings.</p>
