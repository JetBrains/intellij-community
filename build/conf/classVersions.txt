; this is comment line
;
; each line represent a patching rule
;
;  - => path
;     this is exclude rule. It excludes all paths that starts with given prefix,
;     longer path include rule overcomes exclude rule
;  xx => path
;     this is the rule to check that java classes under given path of version xx or older, where xx could
;     be one of the following: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8
;  check static => path
;     this is the rule to check static class usages in classes under given path
;  - check static => path
;     exclude following paths from the check
;  allow static class NAME
;     allow use of given class (by starts-with) from static context
;  include path
;     include content of path (it is relative to the parent directory of current config file) into this file
;
;  see example below
;
;  all paths are relative to scan folder
;
;  exclude rules are checked first
;  longest rule wins
;
;  have fun
