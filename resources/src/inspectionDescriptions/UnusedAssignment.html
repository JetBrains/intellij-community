<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection points out the cases where a variable value
is never used after its assignment, i.e.:<br>
&nbsp;- the variable never gets read after assignment OR<br>
&nbsp;- the value is always overwritten with another assignment before the next variable read OR<br>
&nbsp;- the variable initializer is redundant (for one of the above two reasons) OR<br>
&nbsp;- the variable is never used.</font>
