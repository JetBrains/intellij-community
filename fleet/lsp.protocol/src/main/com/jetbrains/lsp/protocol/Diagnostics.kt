     * if a language has a project system (for example C#) diagnostics are not cleared when a file closes. When a project is opened all diagnostics for all files are recomputed (or read from a cache).
     * When a file changes it is the server’s responsibility to re-compute diagnostics and push them to the client. If the computed set is empty it has to push the empty array to clear former diagnostics.
     * Newly pushed diagnostics always replace previously pushed diagnostics.
     * There is no merging that happens on the client side.
