/**
 * Abstract Rope data structure.
 * Logically rope represents a single contineous value but partitioned into small chunks for faster access and modification.
 * One may think of it as a map-reduce for data.
 * For this reason rope may not be empty, it always contains at least one chunk.
 * Internally Rope is a tree, which maintains a partial sums of certain monotounous metric for each subtree recursively.
 * Later one can access these data, stored in leaves by iteration or logarithmic scan by any of the stored metrics.
 * To define a rope over some abstract type [T], one has to implement [Monoid] interface by some global object.
 * See [andel.text.impl.TextMonoid] for a good example.
 *
 * To access or to modify rope, use [cursor] method.

 * To use Rope, one has to first define a corresponding Monoid type.

 *
 * 1. A way to split and merge chunks of type [T].
 *    Chunks are being merged together if they are to small(their [leafSize] is smaller than [leafSplitThresh] / 2).
 *    Chunks are being split if their [leafSize] is bigger than [leafSplitThresh].
 *    Please choose [leafSplitThresh] constant wisely.
 * 2. Define some number of (no more than 31) metrics using [maxMetric] and [sumMetric] for a chunk.
 *    Each metric is an integer value, accumulated using sum or maximum operation.
 *    Define them as contants in your Monoid object and use them later in [Rope.Cursor.scan].
 *
 * Metrics must be consistent with respect to merge and split:
 * For each defined metric `M` and chunk `t`:
 * - `metrics(M, merge(t1, t2)) == acc(M, metrics(t1), metrics(t2))`
 * - `metrics(M, t) == acc(M, *split(t))`
