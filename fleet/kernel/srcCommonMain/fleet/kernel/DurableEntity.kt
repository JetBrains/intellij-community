 * The entire transitive closure of direct references of a Durable Entity must also be durable.
 * The clients of such entities can assign the [Durable.StorageKeyAttr] attribute to specify the durability policy for them.
 * Consider adding [Version] annotation to it to control the compatibility.
 * When loading the code, entities with an older Versions are retracted from the database.
 * On the other hand, the matching versions will overlive the code successfully, unless the schema is actually changed or serialization error raised,
 * such an event would also lead to the entity retraction together will all other entitis refering them by required attributes.
