<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports exceptions that are declared in a method's signature but never thrown by the method itself.
Only final, private or static methods are analyzed. For other methods, global code analysis is required.
For batch inspections, this can be achieved using <nobr><i>Declaration Redundancy | Redundant throws clause</i>.</nobr></font>
