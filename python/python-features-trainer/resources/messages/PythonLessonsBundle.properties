python.onboarding.run.sample=Choose {0} or try the {1} shortcut.
python.onboarding.temporary.configuration.description=<ide/> has just created a temporary run configuration. You can modify it later to specify the way <ide/> executes your code.
python.onboarding.press.got.it.to.proceed=Press {0} to proceed.
python.onboarding.run.panel.description=You can use this toolbar to modify a run configuration, rerun it, debug your code, collect code coverage, and profile your application. You will have the opportunity to try these workflows in other lessons.
python.onboarding.balloon.click.here=Click here
python.onboarding.toggle.breakpoint=You may notice that the method {0} returns an incorrect value. Let''s stop at the return statement to debug it. Click the gutter in the highlighted area to set a breakpoint.
python.onboarding.balloon.start.debugging=Let's start debugging
python.onboarding.start.debugging=Click the {0} icon to start the debugging process.
python.onboarding.balloon.about.debug.panel=This toolbar provides various debugging actions, such as step in, step over, run to the cursor, and so on. We suggest that you take the {0} lesson later to try them!
python.onboarding.balloon.stop.debugging=Let's stop debugging
python.onboarding.stop.debugging=Click the {0} icon to stop debugging.
python.onboarding.type.division=It seems that we need to divide the resulting sum by the length of the values. Type {0}.
python.onboarding.choose.len.item=<ide/> shows completion variants automatically as you type. Select the {0} item (using the keyboard arrows) and press {1}.
python.onboarding.invoke.completion=The caret is now inside parentheses {0}. Let''s invoke the completion list explicitly by {1}.
python.onboarding.choose.values.item=Select the {0} item and type {1} to reduce the completion list.

python.onboarding.complete.template=Note that the caret has been moved to the place where the return type is specified. Type {0} and then press {1}.
python.onboarding.invoke.search.everywhere=You may notice that we''ve selected {0}. Press {1} two times to open the {2} dialog.
python.onboarding.search.everywhere.description=Here you can find any entity in your project or any feature in <ide/> by searching for its name! As you can see, the selected text has been automatically copied into the input string. And the only item we''ve found is the {0} function from the current file.
python.onboarding.set.input.in.search.everywhere=Now let''s replace {0} with {1} in the input field.
python.onboarding.apply.action=You can see the {0} action. Let''s apply the action: select the highlighted item and press {1}. Or just click it.
python.onboarding.epilog=Congratulations! You have completed the onboarding tour. At this point you can:\
  \n  - <callback id="{0}">Close</callback> the learning project{1}\
  \n  - <callback id="{2}">Create</callback> your own new project\
  \n  - <callback id="{3}">Open</callback> an existing project\
  \n  - <callback id="{4}">Continue</callback> your study
python.onboarding.return.to.welcome=\ and return to the welcome screen

python.f.string.completion.lesson.name=F-string completion
python.f.string.completion.type.prefix=<ide/> supports automatic f-string conversion. Just start typing {0}.
python.f.string.completion.invoke.manually=You can invoke completion manually with {0}.
python.f.string.completion.complete.it=Complete the statement with {0}. Just press {1} to apply the first item.
python.f.string.completion.result.message=You may see that a simple Python string was replaced by f-string after the completion.

python.postfix.completion.select.item=Select {0} item from the completion list.

python.smart.completion.lesson.name=Smart completion
python.smart.completion.try.basic.completion=Try using Basic Completion by pressing {0}.
python.smart.completion.use.smart.completion=Unfortunately, <ide/> has no direct information on the {0} type. \
 But sometimes, it can suggest completion by the context! Use {1} to invoke Smart Completion.
python.smart.completion.finish.completion=Now just choose the {0} item to finish this lesson.

python.tab.completion.lesson.name=Tab completion
python.tab.completion.start.completion=Suppose that you want to replace {0} with {1}. Invoke completion by pressing {2}.
python.tab.completion.select.item=Select the {0} item using the keyboard arrows or just start typing it.
python.tab.completion.use.tab.completion=If you press {0}, you will insert {1} before {2}. Instead, press {3} to replace {2} with {1}.

python.in.place.refactoring.lesson.name=In-place refactoring
python.in.place.refactoring.start.type.new.name=Let''s consider an alternative approach to performing refactorings. \
  Suppose that we want to rename the local variable {0} to {1}. Just start typing the new name.
python.in.place.refactoring.invoke.intentions=<ide/> is guessing that you are going to rename the variable. \
  You can notice it by the {0} icon in the gutter. Invoke intentions by {1} when you finish typing the new name.
python.in.place.refactoring.finish.rename=Press {0} to finish rename.
python.in.place.refactoring.add.parameter=Let''s add an argument to this method. We place the editor caret just after the first parameter. \
  Now type a comma and parameter''s name: {0}.
python.in.place.refactoring.invoke.intention.for.parameter=<ide/> expects that you are going to change the method''s signature. \
  You can notice it by seeing the same icon {0} in the gutter. When you finish typing the new parameter\u2019s name, invoke intentions by pressing {1}.
python.in.place.refactoring.update.callers=Press {0} to update the callers.
python.in.place.refactoring.signature.preview=<ide/> is showing you the short signature preview. Press {0} to continue.
python.in.place.refactoring.set.default.value=Now you need to type the value that will be inserted as an argument into each call. \
  You can choose {0} for this sample. Then press {1} to continue.
python.in.place.refactoring.remark.about.application.scope=Note: In-place refactoring may be applied only in the \
  definition point whiles direct invocation of rename or change-signature refactorings may be called from both definition and usage.

python.quick.fix.refactoring.lesson.name=Quick-fix refactoring
python.quick.fix.refactoring.type.new.argument=Some refactorings can be performed as quick-fixes. \
  Suppose we want to add a parameter to the method {0} and pass the variable {1} to it. Let''s type {2} after the first argument.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.close.completion.list=For now, we don''t want to apply any completion. Close the list ({0}).
python.quick.fix.refactoring.invoke.intentions=As you might have noticed, <ide/> is showing you a warning here. Let''s invoke intentions by pressing {0}.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.choose.change.signature=Choose the {0} quick fix.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.select.new.parameter=Let''s set the default value for the new parameter. Click the new parameter line. \
  Alternatively, you can switch focus to the parameter by pressing {0} and then {1}.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.set.default.value=You may navigate through the fields and the checkbox by using {0}. \
  With the checkbox selected, <ide/> either inlines the default value to the other callers or sets it as the default value for the new parameter. \
  The Signature Preview will help you understand the difference. Now set the default value to 0.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.finish.refactoring=Press {0} (or click {1}) to finish the refactoring.

python.rename.press.rename=Press {0} and rename the {1} field(e.g., to {2}).
python.rename.expand.dynamic.references=In simple cases, {0} will just perform the rename refactoring without confirmation. \
  However, in this sample, <ide/> detects two calls of the {0} method for objects with unknown types. Expand the {1} item.
python.rename.find.window.closed.warning=Press {0} to open the find tool window again.
python.rename.exclude.item=It seems that {0} should be excluded from the rename refactoring. Select it and press {1}.
python.rename.finish.refactoring=Complete the rename refactoring with the {0} button.

python.editor.coding.assistance.fix.error=Let''s fix this error. Press {0} and select {1} or {2} <strong>\u2192 math</strong>

python.run.configuration.lets.run=Let''s run our simple example with {0}.
