python.smart.completion.try.basic.completion=Try using Basic Completion by pressing {0}.
python.smart.completion.use.smart.completion=Unfortunately, <ide/> has no direct information on the {0} type. \
 But sometimes, it can suggest completion by the context! Use {1} to invoke Smart Completion.

python.in.place.refactoring.lesson.name=In-place refactoring
python.in.place.refactoring.start.type.new.name=Let''s consider an alternative approach to performing refactorings. \
  Suppose that we want to rename the local variable {0} to {1}. Just start typing the new name.
python.in.place.refactoring.invoke.intentions=<ide/> is guessing that you are going to rename the variable. \
  You can notice it by the {0} icon in the gutter. Invoke intentions by {1} when you finish typing the new name.
python.in.place.refactoring.finish.rename=Press {0} to finish rename.
python.in.place.refactoring.add.parameter=Let''s add an argument to this method. We place the editor caret just after the first parameter. \
  Now type a comma and parameter''s name: {0}.
python.in.place.refactoring.invoke.intention.for.parameter=<ide/> expects that you are going to change the method''s signature. \
  You can notice it by seeing the same icon {0} in the gutter. When you finish typing the new parameter\u2019s name, invoke intentions by pressing {1}.
python.in.place.refactoring.update.callers=Press {0} to update the callers.
python.in.place.refactoring.signature.preview=<ide/> is showing you the short signature preview. Press {0} to continue.

python.quick.fix.refactoring.choose.change.signature=Choose the {0} quick-fix.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.select.new.parameter=Let''s set the default value for the new parameter. Click the new parameter line. \
  Alternatively, you can switch focus to the parameter by pressing {0} and then {1}.
python.quick.fix.refactoring.set.default.value=You may navigate through the fields and the checkbox by using {0}. \
