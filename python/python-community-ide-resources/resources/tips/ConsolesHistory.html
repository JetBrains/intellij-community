        If you have already spent some time working in the interactive consoles,
        you don't need to re-type the previously entered commands to repeat them.
        Instead, press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorScrollUp;</span> and
        <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:EditorScrollDown;</span> to scroll through
        the history of commands.</p>
