    <p><span class="product">&productName;</span> can work with several projects in one window. 
Open your project, while another one is already opened. Then, depending on the option selected in the 
<span class="control">Project Opening</span> section of the <span class="control">System Settings</span> page of the 
<span class="control">Settings/Preferences</span>, the following happens:
  <ul>
    <li>If the <span class="control">Open project in a new window</span> option is selected, the new project silently opens in a new window. 
     The <span class="control">Attach Project</span> option appears in the <span class="control">File</span> menu.</li>
    <li>If the <span class="control">Open projects in the same window</span> option is selected, the new project silently opens in the same window, 
     replacing the currently opened project. The <span class="control">Attach Project</span> command appears in the <span class="control">File</span> menu.</li>
    <li>If the <span class="control">Confirm window to open project in</span> option is selected, <span class="product">&productName;</span> 
     prompts you to select whether you want to open the project in a new window, reuse the existing window, or attach the new project to the 
     currently opened project. The project that has already been opened is the primary project.</li>
  </ul>
