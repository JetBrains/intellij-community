  <!-- This version of python-plugin-dependencies.xml is used when running IntelliJ IDEA with
       Python plugin from sources. In this configuration, all auxiliary modules (python-javascript-debugger,
       python-localization etc.) are loaded as separate plugins, so they mustnt' be loaded again as
       parts of the Python plugin.

       The version of python-plugin-dependencies.xml used in production builds can be found under the
       'build' directory.
