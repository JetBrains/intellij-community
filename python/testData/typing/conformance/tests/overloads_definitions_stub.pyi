    # These methods are just here for the @override test below. We use an
    # overload because mypy doesn't like overriding a non-overloaded method
    # with an overloaded one, even if LSP isn't violated. That could be its own
    # specification question, but it's not what we're trying to test here:

    # The correctly-decorated @final method `Base.final_method` should cause an

    # questions of override LSP compatibility and focus only on the override):

    # This is the right way to mark an overload as @override (decorate first
    # overload only), so the use of @override should cause an error (because
    # there's no `Base.bad_override` method):

    # overriding a method that does exist in the base, so there should be no
    # error. We need both this test and the previous one, because in the
    # previous test, an incorrect error about the use of @override decorator
    # could appear on the same line as the expected error about overriding a
    # method that doesn't exist in base:

    @overload
    @override

    @overload
