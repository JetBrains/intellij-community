class ndarray(object):
    """
    ndarray(shape, dtype=float, buffer=None, offset=0,
                strides=None, order=None)

        An array object represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array
        of fixed-size items.  An associated data-type object describes the
        format of each element in the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it
        occupies in memory, whether it is an integer, a floating point number,
        or something else, etc.)

        Arrays should be constructed using `array`, `zeros` or `empty` (refer
        to the See Also section below).  The parameters given here refer to
        a low-level method (`ndarray(...)`) for instantiating an array.

        For more information, refer to the `numpy` module and examine the
        the methods and attributes of an array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        (for the __new__ method; see Notes below)

        shape : tuple of ints
            Shape of created array.
        dtype : data-type, optional
            Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type.
        buffer : object exposing buffer interface, optional
            Used to fill the array with data.
        offset : int, optional
            Offset of array data in buffer.
        strides : tuple of ints, optional
            Strides of data in memory.
        order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
            Row-major or column-major order.

        Attributes
        ----------
        T : ndarray
            Transpose of the array.
        data : buffer
            The array's elements, in memory.
        dtype : dtype object
            Describes the format of the elements in the array.
        flags : dict
            Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g.,
            'C_CONTIGUOUS', 'OWNDATA', 'WRITEABLE', etc.
        flat : numpy.flatiter object
            Flattened version of the array as an iterator.  The iterator
            allows assignments, e.g., ``x.flat = 3`` (See `ndarray.flat` for
            assignment examples; TODO).
        imag : ndarray
            Imaginary part of the array.
        real : ndarray
            Real part of the array.
        size : int
            Number of elements in the array.
        itemsize : int
            The memory use of each array element in bytes.
        nbytes : int
            The total number of bytes required to store the array data,
            i.e., ``itemsize * size``.
        ndim : int
            The array's number of dimensions.
        shape : tuple of ints
            Shape of the array.
        strides : tuple of ints
            The step-size required to move from one element to the next in
            memory. For example, a contiguous ``(3, 4)`` array of type
            ``int16`` in C-order has strides ``(8, 2)``.  This implies that
            to move from element to element in memory requires jumps of 2 bytes.
            To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time
            (``2 * 4``).
        ctypes : ctypes object
            Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction
            with ctypes.
        base : ndarray
            If the array is a view into another array, that array is its `base`
            (unless that array is also a view).  The `base` array is where the
            array data is actually stored.

        See Also
        --------
        array : Construct an array.
        zeros : Create an array, each element of which is zero.
        empty : Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e.,
                it contains "garbage").
        dtype : Create a data-type.

        Notes
        -----
        There are two modes of creating an array using ``__new__``:

        1. If `buffer` is None, then only `shape`, `dtype`, and `order`
           are used.
        2. If `buffer` is an object exposing the buffer interface, then
           all keywords are interpreted.

        No ``__init__`` method is needed because the array is fully initialized
        after the ``__new__`` method.

        Examples
        --------
        These examples illustrate the low-level `ndarray` constructor.  Refer
        to the `See Also` section above for easier ways of constructing an
        ndarray.

        First mode, `buffer` is None:

        >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F')
        array([[ -1.13698227e+002,   4.25087011e-303],
               [  2.88528414e-306,   3.27025015e-309]])         #random

        Second mode:

        >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]),
        ...            offset=np.int_().itemsize,
        ...            dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element
        array([2, 3])
    """
    pass
