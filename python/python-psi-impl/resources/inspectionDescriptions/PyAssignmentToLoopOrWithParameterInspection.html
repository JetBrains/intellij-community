Reports the cases when you rewrite a loop variable with an inner loop:
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    for i in range(5):
      for i in range(20, 25):
          print("Inner", i)
      print("Outer", i)
  </pre>

It also warns you if a variable declared in the <code>with</code> statement is redeclared inside of the statement body:
<pre style="font-family: monospace">
    with open("file") as f:
      f.read()
      with open("file") as f:
  </pre>
</body>
</html>
