<p>Reports <code>typing.cast</code> calls where the source and target types are unrelated.</p>
<p>An error is reported when neither the source type is a subtype of the target, nor the target type is a subtype of the source.
  Such casts often indicate a logical error, as an instance of one type cannot be assumed to be an instance of the other,
  and <code>typing.cast</code> does not dynamically validate the type.</p>

<p>This check applies even to types that could theoretically have a common descendant.
  For example, it will flag a cast between two sibling classes <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> that both inherit from <code>Top</code>,
  because there is no direct inheritance relationship between them.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
from typing import cast

# Non-overlapping types â€” likely a mistake
<b>cast(int, "a")</b>          # 'str' -> 'int'
<b>cast(list[int], ["a"])</b>  # 'list[str]' -> 'list[int]'

# Recommended explicit escape hatch is to use a "double cast"
cast(int, <b>cast(object, "a")</b>)  # ok

# Legitimate overlapping cases
cast(int, object())    # a valid down cast
cast(object, 1)        # a valid up cast

# While the following is an invalid cast, as <code>list</code> is invariant. It's not currently supported by this inspection
int_list = [1, 2, 3]
cast(list[object], int_list)
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>The inspection relies on static type information; when a type is unknown, no warning is reported.

  Variance of generic types is not yet considered.</p>
