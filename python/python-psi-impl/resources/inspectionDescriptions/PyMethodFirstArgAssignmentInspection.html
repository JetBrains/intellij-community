<p>Reports cases when the first parameter,
  such as <code>self</code> or <code>cls</code>, is reassigned in a method.
  Because in most cases, there are no objectives in such reassignment, the
  IDE indicates an error.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
class Account:
    def calc(self, balance):
        if balance == 0:
            self = balance
        return self
</code></pre>
<p>As a fix, you might want to check and modify the algorithm to ensure that reassignment is needed. If everything is correct,
  you can invoke intention actions for this code and opt to ignore the warning.</p>
