<p>Reports references in your code that cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>In a dynamically typed language, this is possible in a limited number of cases. </p>
<p>If a reference type is unknown, then its attributes are not highlighted as unresolved even if you know that they should be:</p>
<pre><code>
def print_string(s):
  print(s.abc())
</code></pre>
<p>In this code fragment <code>s</code> is always a string and <code>abc</code> should be highlighted as unresolved. However, <code>s</code>
  type is inferred as <code>Any</code> and no warning is reported.</p>
<p>The IDE provides quick-fix actions to add missing references on-the-fly.</p>
