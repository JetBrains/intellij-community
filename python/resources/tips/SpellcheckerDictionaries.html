<p>If you lack words in the pre-defined dictionaries, you can create your own ones. A custom dictionary is a mere 
textual file with a <span class="code_emphasis">.dic</span> extension, with each word starting on a new line.</p>
<p>All you have to do is to point to the directories where your dictionaries are stored, in the 
<span class="control">Spelling</span> of the <span class="control">Settings</span> dialog.</p>
