<strong>Command line (commands, arguments and options) inspection.</strong>
<p>This inspection checks command you type in command console or command file. It helps you to make sure arguments are on their
  places, option names are correct as well as arguments, provided for options.</p>
<p>Do not disable it if you are going to use command-line interfaces like manage.py in Django</p>
