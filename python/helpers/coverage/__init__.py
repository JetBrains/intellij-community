# Module-level functions.  The original API to this module was based on
# functions defined directly in the module, with a singleton of the coverage()
# class.  That design hampered programmability, so the current api uses
# explicitly-created coverage objects.  But for backward compatibility, here we
# define the top-level functions to create the singleton when they are first
# called.

# Singleton object for use with module-level functions.  The singleton is
# created as needed when one of the module-level functions is called.
