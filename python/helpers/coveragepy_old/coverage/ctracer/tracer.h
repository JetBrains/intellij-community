        The data stack is a stack of dictionaries.  Each dictionary collects
        data for a single source file.  The data stack parallels the call stack:
        each call pushes the new frame's file data onto the data stack, and each
        return pops file data off.

        The file data is a dictionary whose form depends on the tracing options.
        If tracing arcs, the keys are line number pairs.  If not tracing arcs,
        the keys are line numbers.  In both cases, the value is irrelevant
        (None).
