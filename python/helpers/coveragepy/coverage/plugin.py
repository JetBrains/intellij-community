class CoveragePlugin(object):
    """Base class for coverage.py plugins.

    To write a coverage.py plugin, create a module with a subclass of
    :class:`CoveragePlugin`.  You will override methods in your class to
    participate in various aspects of coverage.py's processing.

    Currently the only plugin type is a file tracer, for implementing
    measurement support for non-Python files.  File tracer plugins implement
    the :meth:`file_tracer` method to claim files and the :meth:`file_reporter`
    method to report on those files.

    Any plugin can optionally implement :meth:`sys_info` to provide debugging
    information about their operation.

    Coverage.py will store its own information on your plugin object, using
    attributes whose names start with ``_coverage_``.  Don't be startled.

    To register your plugin, define a function called `coverage_init` in your
    module::

        def coverage_init(reg, options):
            reg.add_file_tracer(MyPlugin())

    You use the `reg` parameter passed to your `coverage_init` function to
    register your plugin object.  It has one method, `add_file_tracer`, which
    takes a newly created instance of your plugin.

    If your plugin takes options, the `options` parameter is a dictionary of
    your plugin's options from the coverage.py configuration file.  Use them
    however you want to configure your object before registering it.

    """

    def file_tracer(self, filename):        # pylint: disable=unused-argument
        """Get a :class:`FileTracer` object for a file.

        Every Python source file is offered to the plugin to give it a chance
        to take responsibility for tracing the file.  If your plugin can handle
        the file, then return a :class:`FileTracer` object.  Otherwise return
        None.

        There is no way to register your plugin for particular files.  Instead,
        this method is invoked for all files, and the plugin decides whether it
        can trace the file or not.  Be prepared for `filename` to refer to all
        kinds of files that have nothing to do with your plugin.

        The file name will be a Python file being executed.  There are two
        broad categories of behavior for a plugin, depending on the kind of
        files your plugin supports:

        * Static file names: each of your original source files has been
          converted into a distinct Python file.  Your plugin is invoked with
          the Python file name, and it maps it back to its original source
          file.

        * Dynamic file names: all of your source files are executed by the same
          Python file.  In this case, your plugin implements
          :meth:`FileTracer.dynamic_source_filename` to provide the actual
          source file for each execution frame.

        `filename` is a string, the path to the file being considered.  This is
        the absolute real path to the file.  If you are comparing to other
        paths, be sure to take this into account.

        Returns a :class:`FileTracer` object to use to trace `filename`, or
        None if this plugin cannot trace this file.
