Fetching The Module Lists
=========================

The lists of modules themselves are grabbed from the Sphinx object inventory (ie the file used by :py:mod:`sphinx.ext.intersphinx` in order to build links to existing Python modules/functions/etc). You probably shouldn't need to mess around with it. But if you want to, here you go.


.. automodule:: stdlib_list.fetch
    :members: fetch_list
