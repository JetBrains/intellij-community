# The following rules are incompatible with or enforced by black:
#       E203 whitespace before ':' -- scripts only
#       E301 expected 1 blank line -- stubs only
#       E302 expected 2 blank lines -- stubs only
#       E305 expected 2 blank lines -- stubs only
#       E501 line too long

# Some rules are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#       E701 multiple statements on one line (colon) -- disallows "..." on the same line
#       F401 imported but unused -- does not recognize re-exports
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/474
#       F822 undefined name in __all__ -- flake8 does not recognize 'foo: Any'
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/533

# Rules that are out of the control of stub authors:
#       E741 ambiguous variable name
#       F403 import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#       F405 defined from star imports

# Rules that we'd like to enable in the future:
#       Y027 Disallow importing typing.ContextManager, typing.OrderedDict &
#            typing_extensions.OrderedDict (cannot be globally enabled while typeshed
#            still contains stubs supporting Python 2).
#       Y034 Detect common errors where certain methods are annotated as having a fixed
#            return type, despite returning self at runtime (temporarily disabled for
#            typing.pyi, enabled elsewhere).
#       Y037 Use PEP 604 syntax instead of `typing.Union` and `typing.Optional`.
#            Currently can't be enabled due to a few lingering bugs in mypy regarding
#            PEP 604 type aliases (see #4819).
