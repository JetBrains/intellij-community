# Pytype blacklist. Files will not be tested with pytype.

# pytype has its own version of these files, and thus doesn't mind if it
# can't parse the typeshed version:
stdlib/2/__builtin__.pyi
stdlib/2/typing.pyi
stdlib/2and3/builtins.pyi
stdlib/3/typing.pyi

# third_party stubs with constructs that pytype doesn't yet support:
third_party/2/fb303/FacebookService.pyi
third_party/2/scribe/scribe.pyi
third_party/2and3/attr/__init__.pyi
third_party/2and3/attr/converters.pyi
