# Pytype blacklist. Files will not be tested with pytype.

# pytype has its own version of these files, and thus doesn't mind if it
# can't parse the typeshed version:
stdlib/2/__builtin__.pyi
stdlib/2/builtins.pyi
stdlib/2/typing.pyi
stdlib/3/builtins.pyi
stdlib/3/typing.pyi
stdlib/3/collections/__init__.pyi # parse only

# builtins not found
stdlib/2/os/__init__.pyi # parse only

# pytype doesn't yet support aliases with implicit type parameters
# (e.g., here, FutureT = Future[T])
stdlib/3.4/asyncio/tasks.pyi
