This directory contains several tests:
- `tests/mypy_test.py`
tests the stubs with [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/)
- `tests/pytype_test.py` tests the stubs with
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/).
- `tests/pyright_test.py` tests the stubs with
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).
- `tests/regr_test.py` runs mypy against the test cases for typeshed's
stubs, guarding against accidental regressions.
- `tests/check_typeshed_structure.py` checks that typeshed's directory
structure and metadata files are correct.
- `tests/stubtest_stdlib.py` checks standard library stubs against the
objects at runtime.
- `tests/stubtest_third_party.py` checks third-party stubs against the
objects at runtime.
- `tests/typecheck_typeshed.py` runs mypy against typeshed's own code
in the `tests` and `scripts` directories.

To run the tests, follow the [setup instructions](../CONTRIBUTING.md#preparing-the-environment)
in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document. In particular, you have to run with Python 3.9+.

In order for `pytype_test` and `pyright_test` to work correctly, some third-party stubs
may require extra dependencies external to typeshed to be installed in your virtual environment
prior to running the test.
You can list or install all of a stubs package's external dependencies using the following script:
```bash
(.venv3)$ python tests/get_external_stub_requirements.py <third_party_stub>  # List external dependencies for <third_party_stub>
(.venv3)$ python tests/get_external_stub_requirements.py <third_party_stub1> <third_party_stub2>  # List external dependencies for <third_party_stub1> and <third_party_stub2>
(.venv3)$ python tests/get_external_stub_requirements.py  # List external dependencies for all third-party stubs in typeshed
# Install external dependencies for all third-party stubs in typeshed
(.venv3)$ DEPENDENCIES=$(python tests/get_external_stub_requirements.py)
(.venv3)$ if [ -n "$DEPENDENCIES" ]; then pip install $DEPENDENCIES; fi
```

## Run all tests for a specific stub

Run using:
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/runtests.py <stdlib-or-stubs>/<stub-to-test>
```

This script will run all tests below for a specific typeshed directory. If a
test supports multiple python versions, the oldest supported by typeshed will
be selected. A summary of the results will be printed to the terminal.

You must provide a single argument which is a path to the stubs to test, like
so: `stdlib/os` or `stubs/requests`.

Run `python tests/runtests.py --help` for information on the various configuration options
for this script. Note that if you use the `--run-stubtest` flag with the stdlib stubs,
whether or not the test passes will depend on the exact version of Python
you're using, as well as various other details regarding your local environment.
For more information, see the docs on [`stubtest_stdlib.py`](#stubtest_stdlibpy) below.

## mypy\_test.py

Run using:
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/mypy_test.py
```

The test has two parts: running mypy on the stdlib stubs,
and running mypy on the third-party stubs.

This test is shallow â€” it verifies that all stubs can be
imported but doesn't check whether stubs match their implementation
(in the Python standard library or a third-party package).

Run `python tests/mypy_test.py --help` for information on the various configuration options
for this script.

## pytype\_test.py

Note: this test cannot be run on Windows
systems unless you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux.
It also requires a Python version < 3.11 as pytype does not yet support
Python 3.11 and above.

Run using:
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/pytype_test.py
```

This test works similarly to `mypy_test.py`, except it uses `pytype`.

## pyright\_test.py

This test requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to be installed. Although
typeshed runs pyright in CI, it does not currently use this script. However,
this script uses the same pyright version and configuration as the CI.
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/pyright_test.py                                # Check all files
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/pyright_test.py stdlib/sys.pyi                 # Check one file
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/pyright_test.py -p pyrightconfig.stricter.json # Check with the stricter config.
```

`pyrightconfig.stricter.json` is a stricter configuration that enables additional
checks that would typically fail on incomplete stubs (such as `Unknown` checks).
In typeshed's CI, pyright is run with these configuration settings on a subset of
the stubs in typeshed (including the standard library).

## regr\_test.py

This test runs mypy against the test cases for typeshed's stdlib and third-party
stubs. See [the REGRESSION.md document](./REGRESSION.md)
in this directory
for more information about what
these test cases are for and how they work. Run `python tests/regr_test.py --help`
for information on the various configuration options.

## check\_typeshed\_structure.py

This checks that typeshed's directory structure and metadata files are correct.

Run using:
```bash
$ python3 tests/check_typeshed_structure.py
```

## stubtest\_stdlib.py

Run using
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/stubtest_stdlib.py
```

This test compares the stdlib stubs against the objects at runtime. Because of
this, the output depends on which version of Python and on what kind of system
it is run.
As such, if you run this test locally, it may complain about system-specific
differences (in e.g, `socket`) that the type system cannot capture or our stubtest settings
in CI do not account for. If you run into this issue, consider opening a draft PR and letting CI
test it automatically (or
[running the test via Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow)
on your typeshed fork).

As a convenience, stubtest\_stdlib.py will look for local-only allowlist files
and use those if they are present. Only version-specific local allowlists are supported.
An example local allowlist file is
`stdlib/@tests/stubtest_allowlists/py312.txt.local`. Use caution when taking advantage of this feature;
the CI run of stubtest remains canonical.

If you need a specific version of Python to repro a CI failure,
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) can also help.

Due to its dynamic nature, you may run into false positives. In this case, you
can add to the allowlists for each affected Python version in
`stdlib/@tests/stubtest_allowlists`. Please file issues for stubtest false positives
at [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues).

## stubtest\_third\_party.py

:warning: This script downloads and executes arbitrary code from PyPI. Only run
this script locally if you know you can trust the packages you're running
stubtest on.

Run using
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/stubtest_third_party.py
```

Similar to `stubtest_stdlib.py`, but tests the third party stubs. By default,
it checks all third-party stubs, but you can provide the distributions to
check on the command line:

```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/stubtest_third_party.py Pillow toml  # check stubs/Pillow and stubs/toml
```

If you have the runtime package installed in your local virtual environment, you can also run stubtest
directly, with
```bash
(.venv3)$ MYPYPATH=<path-to-module-stubs> python3 -m mypy.stubtest \
  --custom-typeshed-dir <path-to-typeshed> \
  <third-party-module>
```

For each distribution, stubtest ignores definitions listed in a `@tests/stubtest_allowlist.txt` file,
relative to the distribution. Platform specific items can be ignored by listing them
in a `@tests/stubtest_allowlist_{platform}.txt` file. Additional packages that are needed
to run stubtest for a
distribution can be added to `tool.stubtest.stubtest_requirements` in `METADATA.toml`.

### Using stubtest to find objects missing from the stubs

By default, stubtest emits an error if a public object is present at runtime
but missing from the stub. However, this behaviour can be disabled using the
`--ignore-missing-stub` option.

If a distribution has `ignore_missing_stub = true` in the `[tool.stubtest]` section of its
`tests/METADATA.toml` file, `stubtest_third_party.py` will test that distribution with the
`--ignore-missing-stub` option. This indicates that the stubs for this distribution are
considered "incomplete".

You can help make typeshed's stubs more complete by removing
`ignore_missing_stub = true` from the `tests/METADATA.toml` file for a
third-party stubs distribution, running stubtest, and then adding things that
stubtest reports to be missing to the stub. However, note that not *everything*
that stubtest reports to be missing should necessarily be added to the stub.
For some implementation details, it is often better to add allowlist entries
for missing objects rather than trying to match the runtime in every detail.

## typecheck\_typeshed.py

Run using
```bash
(.venv3)$ python3 tests/typecheck_typeshed.py
```

This is a small wrapper script that uses mypy to typecheck typeshed's own code in the
`scripts` and `tests` directories. Run `python tests/typecheck_typeshed.py --help` for
information on the various configuration options.
