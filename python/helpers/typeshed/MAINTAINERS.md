Former maintainers include:

* Matthias Kramm (@matthiaskramm)
* ≈Åukasz Langa (@ambv)
* Greg Price (@gnprice)
* Rune Tynan (@CraftSpider)

For security reasons, maintainers who haven't been active for twelve months
(no PR reviews or merges, no opened PRs, no significant participation in
issues or on typing-sig) will have their access rights removed. They will
also be moved to the "former maintainers" section here.

Former maintainers who want their access rights restored should open
an issue or mail one of the active maintainers.
