# Error: variable differs from runtime
# ======================
# _unbound_fields has some weird semantics: due to the metaclass it
# will be None until the form class has been instantiated at least
# once and then will stick around until someone adds a new field
# to the class, which clears it back to None. Which means on instances
# it will always be there and on the class it depends, so maybe this
# should use a dummy descriptor? For now we just pretend it's set.
# The behavior is documented in FormMeta, so I think it's fine.
