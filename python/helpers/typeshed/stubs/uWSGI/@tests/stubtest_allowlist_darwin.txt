# These functions depend on modules which are not built into
# the MacOS wheel by default, so we just ignore them for now
# we don't want to pretend they don't exist, because people
# could still configure a build with the required modules
# manually, we don't do that for typeshed, since it would
# add a lot of additional complexity to stubtest_third_party
