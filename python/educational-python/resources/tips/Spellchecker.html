<p>Keep your source code typo-free with the help of the built-in <span class="">Spellchecker</span>.</p>

<p>All texts, including comments, textual strings and literals, are inspected against the pre-defined dictionaries. 
All typos are highlighted, which leaves you with the task of choosing the correct word, accepting the current spelling, or disabling inspection.</p>
