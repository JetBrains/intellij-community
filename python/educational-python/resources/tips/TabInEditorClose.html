      <p>Did you know that you can close tabs in the editor and the tool windows of &productName; without actually
          using the context menu commands?
      It is enough to point with your mouse cursor to a tab to be closed, and click the middle mouse button, or just
      use the <span class="shortcut">Shift+click</span> combination.</p>
