 * ProjectSynchronizer is an engine that synchronize code between local and remote system or between java (which is local)
 * and python (which may be remote).
 * This engine is sdk-specific and used by [com.jetbrains.python.newProject.PythonProjectGenerator] (and friends).
 *
 * When generator creates remote project, it may use python helpers (with aid of tasks) and it may need some way
 * to pull remote files, patch them and push 'em back. The way it does it is skd-specific and this interface encapsulates it.
 *
 * Using this engine makes your generator compatible with remote interpreters.
 *
 * Project synchronizer is also responsible for project configuration for sync: it cooperates with user to make sure remote project is
 * configured correctly.
