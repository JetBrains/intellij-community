/**
 * Say, you need to create a new project for framework "Foo".
 * There are three items to implement:
 * <p/>
 * {@link com.jetbrains.python.newProjectWizard.PyV3ProjectTypeSpecificSettings} is a something that stores settings and generates project
 * based on them (and other things like SDK and module).
 * <p/>
 * {@link com.jetbrains.python.newProjectWizard.PyV3ProjectTypeSpecificUI} is a class that binds settings, mentioned above, to the Kotlin DSL UI panel.
 * <p/>
 * {@link com.jetbrains.python.newProjectWizard.PyV3ProjectBaseGenerator} connects these two and must be registered as EP.
