| Aspect    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hashes    | Hashes aspect generates(`-g`) or checks(`-c`, default) IDE integrity by inspecting checksums of all installation files.<br/> Hashes aspect returns Warning if some files are missing, or distribution has redundant files inside |
| log       | Log aspect inspects idea.log file for exceptions and errors generated by plugins. In case of Warnings, it asks to remove caches and configs.                                                                                     |
| plugins   | Plugins aspect scans all the installed plugins and suggest fixes if some of them are incompatible or require updates.                                                                                                            |
| runtime   | Runtime aspect finds the JDK used to start the IDE and checks if it is OK to use. Sets the bundled JDK in case of warnings.                                                                                                      |
| vmoptions | Vmoptions aspect finds the .vmoptions file used by the IDE and analyzes its content for suspicious entries. If any of them found, one can edit the file manually, or reset VM options to default.                                |

If no aspects passed, all aspects will be executed one by one.
