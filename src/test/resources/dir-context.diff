- The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
- The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

    so we may see their subtlety,
  And let there always be being,

  The two are the same,
  But after they are produced,
    they have different names.
+ They both may be called deep and profound.
+ Deeper and more profound,
+ The door of all subtleties!
