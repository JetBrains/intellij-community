  <p>The Original Code of SAXON comprises all those components which are not explicitly attributed
    to other parties. It does not include the &AElig;lfred parser, which is redistributed under
    the licence described below.</p>

  <p>The Initial Developer of the Original Code was Michael Kay.
    Individual modules identified as being created by James Clark, David Megginson, or John Cowan include
    separate IPR notices. All Rights Reserved.</p>

  <p>
    <small><i>Until January 2001 Michael Kay worked for International Computers Limited (ICL, now part
      of Fujitsu), and from February 2001 to January 2004 he worked for Software AG. These two companies
      both sponsored the development of Saxon and authorised its release under this license, but are not
      themselves parties to the license. Michael Kay now runs his own company, Saxonica, which has taken
      over all responsibility for Saxon development and support.</i></small>
  </p>

  <p>
    <small><i>For reasons of continuity,
      the icl.com domain name is retained in package names and namespace URIs with the tacit
      consent of ICL, but this should not be taken to imply any ongoing ICL involvement.</small>
    </i></p>

  <p>If you produce a product that includes or requires SAXON, please refer to it as
    &quot;The SAXON XSLT Processor from Michael Kay&quot;, and include the URL of the
    home page, which is at
    <a HREF="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p>

  <p>There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able to answer enquiries
    within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing list available at
    <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help"/>
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</a> and raise any enquiries there.
    Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge for details of known errors; all bugs are
    listed there as soon as I have sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.</p>

  <h2>&AElig;lfred</h2>

  <p>Included in the Saxon distribution is a modified version of the &AElig;lfred XML parser
    originally developed by David Megginson at Microstar (no longer in existence).
    I have taken the relevant part of
    <A href="mailto:david-b@pacbell.net">David Brownell</a>'s
    <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/david-b/xml/">&AElig;lfred2</a> distribution, repackaged it,
    and fixed a few bugs. All changes are clearly documented in the source code.</p>

  <p>This is distributed under the terms of Microstar's terms and conditions, which are as follows:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>

  <p>The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000,
    modified as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changed the package name to com.icl.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental confusion with the
      original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx
      declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end of file occurs prematurely
    </li>
    <li>Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and SAX driver, with appropriate
      changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() methods.
    </li>
    <li>Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been incorporated.</li>
  </ul>
