Reports character escapes that are replaceable with the unescaped character without a change in meaning.
Note that inside the square brackets of a character class, many escapes are unnecessary that would be necessary outside of a character class.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  \-\;[\.]
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  -;[.]
</code></pre>
