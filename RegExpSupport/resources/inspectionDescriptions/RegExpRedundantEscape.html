Reports character escapes that are replaceable with the unescaped character without a change in meaning.
Note that inside the square brackets of a character class, many escapes are unnecessary that would be necessary outside of a character class.
<p>
This inspection doesn't warn on opening curly braces (<code>{</code>) outside of character classes (<code>[]</code>).
Removing the escape before an opening curly brace can cause confusion,
even though this is allowed in e.g. the Javascript and Python regex dialects.
It would also make the regex pattern less portable, because many other dialects don't allow unescaped curly braces as characters.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  \-\;[\.]
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  -;[.]
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the <b>Ignore escaped closing brackets '}' and ']'</b> option
to specify if '\}' and '\]' should be reported when they are not inside a character class
and they are allowed to be unescaped by the RegExp dialect.
