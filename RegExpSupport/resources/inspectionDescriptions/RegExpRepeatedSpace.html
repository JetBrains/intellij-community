Reports multiple consecutive spaces in a RegExp.
Because spaces are not visible by default, it can be hard to see how many spaces are required.
The RegExp can be made more clear by replacing the consecutive spaces with a single space and a counted quantifier.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  (     )
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  ( {5})
</code></pre>
