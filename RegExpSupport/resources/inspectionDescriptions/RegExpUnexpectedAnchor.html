Reports <code>^</code> or <code>\A</code> anchors not at the beginning of the pattern and
<code>$</code>, <code>\Z</code> or <code>\z</code> anchors not at the end of the pattern.
In the wrong position these RegExp anchors prevent the pattern from matching anything.
In case of the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> anchors, most likely the literal character was meant and the escape forgotten.
