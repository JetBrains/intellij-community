Reports character escapes that are replaceable with the unescaped character without a change in meaning.
Note that inside the square brackets of a character class, many escapes are unnecessary that would be necessary outside of a character class.
For example the regex <b><code>[\.]</code></b> is identical to <b><code>[.]</code></b>
