<p>This inspection reports when equality check is performed for specific classes like
  <code>StringBuilder</code> or <code>StringBuffer</code> for which <code>equals()</code> is not
  redefined. Such call will not compare object contents and is equivalent to the reference
  equality. If reference equality is intended, it's better to use <code>==</code> explicitly
  to avoid confusion.
