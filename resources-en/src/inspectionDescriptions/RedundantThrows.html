<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports exceptions that are declared in a method's signature but never
thrown by the method itself or its implementations/derivatives. Since this inspection requires global code analysis,
it is only available in batch inspection mode. A limited version for use in editor highlighting is available as
<nobr><i>General | Redundant throws declaration</i>.</nobr></font>
