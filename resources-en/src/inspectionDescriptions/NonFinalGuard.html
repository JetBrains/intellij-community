               This inspection reports any @GuardedBy annotations (net.jcip.annotations|javax.annotation.concurrent|org.apache.http.annotation) annotations where the guarding field
                is not final. Gaurding on a non-final field may result in unexpected race conditions, as locks will
                be held on the value of the field (which may change), rather than the field itself.
