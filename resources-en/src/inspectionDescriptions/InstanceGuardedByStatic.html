               This inspection reports any @GuardedBy annotations (net.jcip.annotations|javax.annotation.concurrent|org.apache.http.annotation) on instance fields or methods,
                where the guard is a static field. Guarding a non-static by a static may result in excessive lock contention,
                as access to each locked field in any object instance will prevent simultaneous access to that field in every object instance.
