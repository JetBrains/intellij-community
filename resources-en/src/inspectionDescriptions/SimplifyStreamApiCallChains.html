This inspection reports stream API call chains which can be simplified.
It allows to avoid creating redundant temporary objects when traversing a collection.
<p>
For example, <b>Collection.stream().forEach()</b> can be replaced with <b>Collection.forEach()</b>.
<p>
Note that <b>forEachOrdered()</b> is a special case. While the traversal order of <b>Collection.forEach()</b> is usually the same as with
<b>Collection.stream().forEachOrdered()</b>, specific implementations may override that. Please check the documentation on the collection's implementation.
