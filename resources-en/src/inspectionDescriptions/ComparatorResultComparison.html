This inspection warns when result of <b>Comparator.compare</b> or <b>Comparable.compareTo</b> is compared with
  specific non-zero constant (like <b>if(a.compareTo(b) == -1)</b>). By contract,
  these methods can return any positive number (not just 1) or any negative number (not just -1), so comparing against
  particular numbers is a bad practice.
