/**
 * If you have several {@link SubTagList} collections and you need to access them all at once, this
  annotation will help. "value" property will hold the array of possible subtag names. One should have different
  addition methods for each subtag name, each returning its own DomElement type, each may have an "index" parameter.
  The element will be inserted in proper place in the "merged" collection, allowing you to mix elements of different
  types (if Schema or DTD allows).
